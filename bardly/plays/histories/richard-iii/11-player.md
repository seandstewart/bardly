# Richard III,  11 players

## ACT I

### SCENE I. London. A street.

*Enter GLOUCESTER, solus*

**GLOUCESTER**  
Now is the winter of our discontent  
Made glorious summer by this sun of York;  
And all the clouds that lour'd upon our house  
In the deep bosom of the ocean buried.  
Now are our brows bound with victorious wreaths;  
Our bruised arms hung up for monuments;  
Our stern alarums changed to merry meetings,  
Our dreadful marches to delightful measures.  
Grim-visaged war hath smooth'd his wrinkled front;  
And now, instead of mounting barbed steeds  
To fright the souls of fearful adversaries,  
He capers nimbly in a lady's chamber  
To the lascivious pleasing of a lute.  
But I, that am not shaped for sportive tricks,  
Nor made to court an amorous looking-glass;  
I, that am rudely stamp'd, and want love's majesty  
To strut before a wanton ambling nymph;  
I, that am curtail'd of this fair proportion,  
Cheated of feature by dissembling nature,  
Deformed, unfinish'd, sent before my time  
Into this breathing world, scarce half made up,  
And that so lamely and unfashionable  
That dogs bark at me as I halt by them;  
Why, I, in this weak piping time of peace,  
Have no delight to pass away the time,  
Unless to spy my shadow in the sun  
And descant on mine own deformity:  
And therefore, since I cannot prove a lover,  
To entertain these fair well-spoken days,  
I am determined to prove a villain  
And hate the idle pleasures of these days.  
Plots have I laid, inductions dangerous,  
By drunken prophecies, libels and dreams,  
To set my brother Clarence and the king  
In deadly hate the one against the other:  
And if King Edward be as true and just  
As I am subtle, false and treacherous,  
This day should Clarence closely be mew'd up,  
About a prophecy, which says that 'G'  
Of Edward's heirs the murderer shall be.  
Dive, thoughts, down to my soul: here  
Clarence comes.

*Enter CLARENCE, guarded by BRAKENBURY*

Brother, good day; what means this armed guard  
That waits upon your grace? /

**CLARENCE**  
/ His majesty  
Tendering my person's safety, hath appointed  
This conduct to convey me to the Tower.

**GLOUCESTER**  
Upon what cause? /

**CLARENCE**  
/ Because my name is George.

**GLOUCESTER**  
Alack, my lord, that fault is none of yours;  
He should, for that, commit your godfathers:  
O, belike his majesty hath some intent  
That you shall be new-christen'd in the Tower.  
But what's the matter, Clarence? may I know?

**CLARENCE**  
Yea, Richard, when I know; for I protest  
As yet I do not: but, as I can learn,  
He hearkens after prophecies and dreams;  
And says a wizard told him that by G  
His issue disinherited should be;  
And, for my name of George begins with G,  
It follows in his thought that I am he.

**GLOUCESTER**  
Why, this it is, when men are ruled by women:  
'Tis not the king that sends you to the Tower:  
My Lady Grey his wife, Clarence, 'tis she  
That tempers him to this extremity.  
Was it not she and that good man of worship,  
Anthony Woodville, her brother there,  
That made him send Lord Hastings to the Tower,  
From whence this present day he is deliver'd?  
We are not safe, Clarence; we are not safe.

**CLARENCE**  
By heaven, I think there's no man is secure  
But the queen's kindred and night-walking heralds.  
Heard ye not what an humble suppliant  
Lord Hastings was to her for his delivery?

**GLOUCESTER**  
Humbly complaining to her deity  
Got my lord chamberlain his liberty.

**BRAKENBURY**  
I beseech your graces both to pardon me;  
His majesty hath straitly given in charge  
That no man shall have private conference,  
Of what degree soever, with his brother.

**GLOUCESTER**  
We are the queen's abjects, and must obey.  
Brother, farewell: I will unto the king;  
And whatsoever you will employ me in,  
I will perform it to enfranchise you.  
Meantime, this deep disgrace in brotherhood  
Touches me deeper than you can imagine.

**CLARENCE**  
I know it pleaseth neither of us well.

**GLOUCESTER**  
Well, your imprisonment shall not be long;  
Meantime, have patience. /

**CLARENCE**  
/ I must perforce. Farewell.

*Exeunt CLARENCE and BRAKENBURY*

**GLOUCESTER**  
Go, tread the path that thou shalt ne'er return.  
Simple, plain Clarence! I do love thee so,  
That I will shortly send thy soul to heaven,  
If heaven will take the present at our hands.  
But who comes here? the new-deliver'd Hastings?

*Enter HASTINGS*

**HASTINGS**  
Good time of day unto my gracious lord!

**GLOUCESTER**  
As much unto my good lord chamberlain!  
How hath your lordship brook'd imprisonment?

**HASTINGS**  
With patience, noble lord, as prisoners must:  
But I shall live, my lord, to give them thanks  
That were the cause of my imprisonment.

**GLOUCESTER**  
No doubt, no doubt; and so shall Clarence too;  
For they that were your enemies are his,  
And have prevail'd as much on him as you.
What news abroad?

**HASTINGS**  
No news so bad abroad as this at home;  
The King is sickly, weak and melancholy,  
And his physicians fear him mightily.

**GLOUCESTER**  
Now, by Saint Paul, this news is bad indeed.  
O, he hath kept an evil diet long,  
And overmuch consumed his royal person:  
What, is he in his bed?

**HASTINGS**  
He is.

**GLOUCESTER**  
Go you before, and I will follow you.

*Exit HASTINGS*

He cannot live, I hope; and must not die  
Till George be pack'd with post-horse up to heaven.  
I'll in, to urge his hatred more to Clarence,  
With lies well steel'd with weighty arguments;  
And, if I fall not in my deep intent,  
Clarence hath not another day to live:  
Which done, God take King Edward to his mercy,  
And leave the world for me to bustle in!  
For then I'll marry Warwick's youngest daughter.  
What though I kill'd her husband and her father?  
The readiest way to make the wench amends  
Is to become her husband and her father:  
The which will I; not all so much for love  
As for another secret close intent,  
By marrying her which I must reach unto.  
But yet I run before my horse to market:  
Clarence still breathes; Edward still lives and reigns:  
When they are gone, then must I count my gains.

*Exit*

### SCENE II. The same. Another street.

*Enter the corpse of KING HENRY the Sixth, Guards with
halberds to guard it; LADY ANNE being the mourner*

**LADY ANNE**  
Set down, set down your honourable load,  
If honour may be shrouded in a hearse,  
Whilst I awhile obsequiously lament  
The untimely fall of virtuous Lancaster.  
Thou bloodless remnant of that royal blood!  
Be it lawful that I invocate thy ghost,  
To hear the lamentations of Poor Anne,  
Wife to thy Edward, to thy slaughter'd son,  
Stabb'd by the selfsame hand that made these wounds!  
Lo, in these windows that let forth thy life,  
I pour the helpless balm of my poor eyes.  
Cursed be the hand that made these fatal holes!  
Cursed be the heart that had the heart to do it!  
Cursed the blood that let this blood from hence!  
If ever he have wife, let her he made  
A' miserable by the death of him  
As I am made by my poor lord and thee!  
Come, now towards Chertsey with your holy load,  
Taken from Paul's to be interred there;  
And still, as you are weary of the weight,  
Rest you, whiles I lament King Henry's corse.

*Enter GLOUCESTER*

**GLOUCESTER**  
Stay, you that bear the corse, and set it down.

**LADY ANNE**  
What black magician conjures up this fiend,  
To stop devoted charitable deeds?

**GLOUCESTER**  
Villains, set down the corse; or, by Saint Paul,  
I'll make a corse of him that disobeys.

**LADY ANNE**  
What, do you tremble? are you both afraid?  
Alas, I blame you not; for you are mortal,  
And mortal eyes cannot endure the devil.  
Avaunt, thou dreadful minister of hell!  
Thou hadst but power over his mortal body,  
His soul thou canst not have; therefore be gone.

**GLOUCESTER**  
Sweet saint, for charity, be not so curst.

**LADY ANNE**  
Foul devil, for God's sake, hence, and trouble us not;  
For thou hast made the happy earth thy hell,  
Fill'd it with cursing cries and deep exclaims.  
If thou delight to view thy heinous deeds,  
Behold this pattern of thy butcheries.  
O, gentlemen, see, see! dead Henry's wounds  
Open their congeal'd mouths and bleed afresh!  
Blush, Blush, thou lump of foul deformity;  
For 'tis thy presence that exhales this blood  
From cold and empty veins, where no blood dwells;  
Thy deed, inhuman and unnatural,  
Provokes this deluge most unnatural.  
O God, which this blood madest, revenge his death!  
O earth, which this blood drink'st revenge his death!  
Either heaven with lightning strike the murderer dead,  
Or earth, gape open wide and eat him quick,  
As thou dost swallow up this good king's blood  
Which his hell-govern'd arm hath butchered!

**GLOUCESTER**  
Lady, you know no rules of charity,  
Which renders good for bad, blessings for curses.

**LADY ANNE**  
Villain, thou know'st no law of God nor man:  
No beast so fierce but knows some touch of pity.

**GLOUCESTER**  
But I know none, and therefore am no beast.

**LADY ANNE**  
O wonderful, when devils tell the truth!

**GLOUCESTER**  
More wonderful, when angels are so angry.  
Vouchsafe, divine perfection of a woman,  
Of these supposed-evils, to give me leave,  
By circumstance, but to acquit myself.

**LADY ANNE**  
Vouchsafe, defused infection of a man,  
For these known evils, but to give me leave,  
By circumstance, to curse thy cursed self.

**GLOUCESTER**  
Fairer than tongue can name thee, let me have  
Some patient leisure to excuse myself.

**LADY ANNE**  
Fouler than heart can think thee, thou canst make  
No excuse current, but to hang thyself.

**GLOUCESTER**  
By such despair, I should accuse myself.

**LADY ANNE**  
And, by despairing, shouldst thou stand excused;  
For doing worthy vengeance on thyself,  
Which didst unworthy slaughter upon others.  
Didst thou not kill this king? /

**GLOUCESTER**  
/ I grant ye.

**LADY ANNE**  
Dost grant me, hedgehog? then, God grant me too  
Thou mayst be damned for that wicked deed!  
O, he was gentle, mild, and virtuous!

**GLOUCESTER**  
The fitter for the King of heaven, that hath him.

**LADY ANNE**  
He is in heaven, where thou shalt never come.

**GLOUCESTER**  
Let him thank me, that holp to send him thither;  
For he was fitter for that place than earth.

**LADY ANNE**  
And thou unfit for any place but hell.

**GLOUCESTER**  
Yes, one place else, if you will hear me name it.

**LADY ANNE**  
Some dungeon. /

**GLOUCESTER**  
/ Your bed-chamber.

**LADY ANNE**  
Ill rest betide the chamber where thou liest!

**GLOUCESTER**  
So will it, madam till I lie with you.

**LADY ANNE**  
I hope so. /

**GLOUCESTER**  
/ I know so. But, gentle Lady Anne,  
To leave this keen encounter of our wits,  
And fall somewhat into a slower method,  
Is not the causer of the timeless deaths  
Of these Plantagenets, Henry and Edward,  
As blameful as the executioner?

**LADY ANNE**  
Thou art the cause, and most accursed effect.

**GLOUCESTER**  
Your beauty was the cause of that effect;  
Your beauty: which did haunt me in my sleep  
To undertake the death of all the world,  
So I might live one hour in your sweet bosom.

**LADY ANNE**  
If I thought that, I tell thee, homicide,  
These nails should rend that beauty from my cheeks.

**GLOUCESTER**  
These eyes could never endure sweet beauty's wreck;  
You should not blemish it, if I stood by:  
As all the world is cheered by the sun,  
So I by that; it is my day, my life.

**LADY ANNE**  
Black night o'ershade thy day, and death thy life!

**GLOUCESTER**  
Curse not thyself, fair creature thou art both.

**LADY ANNE**  
I would I were, to be revenged on thee.

**GLOUCESTER**  
It is a quarrel most unnatural,  
To be revenged on him that loveth you.

**LADY ANNE**  
It is a quarrel just and reasonable,  
To be revenged on him that slew my husband.

**GLOUCESTER**  
He that bereft thee, lady, of thy husband,  
Did it to help thee to a better husband.

**LADY ANNE**  
His better doth not breathe upon the earth.

**GLOUCESTER**  
He lives that loves thee better than he could.

**LADY ANNE**  
Name him. /

**GLOUCESTER**  
/ Plantagenet. /

**LADY ANNE**  
/ Why, that was he.

**GLOUCESTER**  
The selfsame name, but one of better nature.

**LADY ANNE**  
Where is he? /

**GLOUCESTER**  
/ Here. /

*She spitteth at him*

/ Why dost thou spit at me?

**LADY ANNE**  
Would it were mortal poison, for thy sake!

**GLOUCESTER**  
Never came poison from so sweet a place.

**LADY ANNE**  
Never hung poison on a fouler toad.  
Out of my sight! thou dost infect my eyes.

**GLOUCESTER**  
Thine eyes, sweet lady, have infected mine.

**LADY ANNE**  
Would they were basilisks, to strike thee dead!

**GLOUCESTER**  
I would they were, that I might die at once;  
For now they kill me with a living death.  
Those eyes of thine from mine have drawn salt tears,  
Shamed their aspect with store of childish drops.  
I never sued to friend nor enemy;  
My tongue could never learn sweet smoothing word;  
But now thy beauty is proposed my fee,  
My proud heart sues, and prompts my tongue to speak.

*She looks scornfully at him*

Teach not thy lips such scorn, for they were made  
For kissing, lady, not for such contempt.  
If thy revengeful heart cannot forgive,  
Lo, here I lend thee this sharp-pointed sword;  
Which if thou please to hide in this true bosom,  
I lay it naked to the deadly stroke,  
And humbly beg the death upon my knee.

*He lays his breast open: she offers at it with his sword*

Nay, do not pause; for I did kill King Henry,  
But 'twas thy beauty that provoked me.  
Nay, now dispatch; 'twas I that stabb'd young Edward,  
But 'twas thy heavenly face that set me on.

*Here she lets fall the sword*

Take up the sword again, or take up me.

**LADY ANNE**  
Arise, dissembler: though I wish thy death,  
I will not be the executioner.

**GLOUCESTER**  
Then bid me kill myself, and I will do't.

**LADY ANNE**  
I have already. /

**GLOUCESTER**  
/ Tush, that was in thy rage:  
Speak it again, and, even with the word,  
That hand, which, for thy love, did kill thy love,  
Shall, for thy love, kill a far truer love;  
To both their deaths thou shalt be accessary.

**LADY ANNE**  
I would I knew thy heart. /

**GLOUCESTER**  
/ 'Tis figured in my tongue.

**LADY ANNE**  
I fear me both are false. /

**GLOUCESTER**  
/ Then never man was true.

**LADY ANNE**  
Well, well, put up your sword. /

**GLOUCESTER**  
/ Say, then, my peace is made.

**LADY ANNE**  
That shall you know hereafter. /

**GLOUCESTER**  
/ But shall I live in hope?

**LADY ANNE**  
All men, I hope, live so. /

**GLOUCESTER**  
/ Vouchsafe to wear this ring.

**LADY ANNE**  
To take is not to give.

**GLOUCESTER**  
Look, how this ring encompasseth finger.  
Even so thy breast encloseth my poor heart;  
Wear both of them, for both of them are thine.  
And if thy poor devoted suppliant may  
But beg one favour at thy gracious hand,  
Thou dost confirm his happiness forever.

**LADY ANNE**  
What is it?

**GLOUCESTER**  
That it would please thee leave these sad designs  
To him that hath more cause to be a mourner,  
And presently repair to Crosby Place;  
Where, after I have solemnly interr'd  
At Chertsey monastery this noble king,  
And wet his grave with my repentant tears,  
I will with all expedient duty see you:  
For divers unknown reasons. I beseech you,  
Grant me this boon.

**LADY ANNE**  
With all my heart; and much it joys me too,  
To see you are become so penitent.

**GLOUCESTER**  
Bid me farewell. /

**LADY ANNE**  
/ 'Tis more than you deserve;  
But since you teach me how to flatter you,  
Imagine I have said farewell already.

*Exeunt LADY ANNE*

**GLOUCESTER**  
Sirs, take up the corse. /

**Guard**  
/ Towards Chertsey, noble lord?

**GLOUCESTER**  
No, to White-Friars; there attend my coining.

*Exeunt all but GLOUCESTER*

Was ever woman in this humor woo'd?  
Was ever woman in this humor won?  
I'll have her; but I will not keep her long.  
What! I, that kill'd her husband and his father,  
To take her in her heart's extremest hate,  
With curses in her mouth, tears in her eyes,  
The bleeding witness of her hatred by;  
Having God, her conscience, and these bars against me,  
And I nothing to back my suit at all,  
But the plain devil and dissembling looks,  
And yet to win her, all the world to nothing!  
Ha!  
Hath she forgot already that brave prince,  
Edward, her lord, whom I, some three months since,  
Stabb'd in my angry mood at Tewksbury?  
And will she yet debase her eyes on me,  
That cropp'd the golden prime of this sweet prince,  
And made her widow to a woful bed?  
On me, whose all not equals Edward's moiety?  
On me, that halt and am unshapen thus?  
My dukedom to a beggarly denier,  
I do mistake my person all this while:  
Upon my life, she finds, although I cannot,  
Myself to be a marvellous proper man.  
I'll be at charges for a looking-glass,  
And entertain some score or two of tailors,  
To study fashions to adorn my body:  
But first I'll turn yon fellow in his grave;  
And then return lamenting to my love.  
Shine out, fair sun, till I have bought a glass,  
That I may see my shadow as I pass.

*Exit*

### SCENE III. The palace.

*Enter QUEEN ELIZABETH, and RIVERS*

**RIVERS**  
Have patience, madam: there's no doubt his majesty  
Will soon recover his accustom'd health.

**QUEEN ELIZABETH**  
If he were dead, what would betide of me?

**RIVERS**  
No other harm but loss of such a lord.

**QUEEN ELIZABETH**  
The loss of such a lord includes all harm.

**RIVERS**  
The heavens have bless'd you with a goodly son,  
To be your comforter when he is gone.

**QUEEN ELIZABETH**  
Oh, he is young and his minority  
Is put unto the trust of Richard Gloucester,  
A man that loves not me, nor none of you.

**RIVERS**  
Is it concluded that he shall be protector?

**QUEEN ELIZABETH**  
It is determined, not concluded yet:  
But so it must be, if the king miscarry.

*Enter BUCKINGHAM and DERBY*

**RIVERS**  
Here come the lords of Buckingham and Derby.

**BUCKINGHAM**  
Good time of day unto your royal grace!

**DERBY**  
God make your majesty joyful as you have been!

**RIVERS**  
Saw you the king today, my Lord of Derby?

**DERBY**  
But now the Duke of Buckingham and I  
Are come from visiting his majesty.

**QUEEN ELIZABETH**  
What likelihood of his amendment, lords?

**BUCKINGHAM**  
Madam, good hope; his grace speaks cheerfully.

**QUEEN ELIZABETH**  
God grant him health! Did you confer with him?

**BUCKINGHAM**  
Madam, we did: he desires to make atonement  
Betwixt the Duke of Gloucester and your brothers,  
And betwixt them and my lord chamberlain;  
And sent to warn them to his royal presence.

**QUEEN ELIZABETH**  
Would all were well! but that will never be  
I fear our happiness is at the highest.

*Enter GLOUCESTER, and HASTINGS*

**GLOUCESTER**  
They do me wrong, and I will not endure it:  
Who are they that complain unto the king,  
That I, forsooth, am stern, and love them not?  
Cannot a plain man live and think no harm,  
But thus his simple truth must be abused  
By silken, sly, insinuating Jacks?

**RIVERS**  
To whom in all this presence speaks your grace?

**GLOUCESTER**  
To thee, that hast nor honesty nor grace.  
When have I injured thee? when done thee wrong?  
Or thee? or thee? or any of your faction?  
A plague upon you all! His royal person,--  
Whom God preserve better than you would wish!--  
Cannot be quiet scarce a breathing-while,  
But you must trouble him with lewd complaints.

**QUEEN ELIZABETH**  
Brother of Gloucester, you mistake the matter.  
The king, of his own royal disposition,  
And not provoked by any suitor else;  
Aiming, belike, at your interior hatred,  
Which in your outward actions shows itself  
Against my kindred, brothers, and myself,  
Makes him to send; that thereby he may gather  
The ground of your ill-will, and so remove it.
Come, come, we know your meaning, brother Gloucester;  
You envy my advancement and my friends':  
God grant we never may have need of you!

**GLOUCESTER**  
Meantime, God grants that we have need of you:  
Your brother is imprison'd by your means,  
Myself disgraced, and the nobility  
Held in contempt; whilst many fair promotions  
Are daily given to ennoble those  
That scarce, some two days since, were worth a noble.

**QUEEN ELIZABETH**  
By Him that raised me to this careful height  
From that contented hap which I enjoy'd,  
I never did incense his majesty  
Against the Duke of Clarence, but have been  
An earnest advocate to plead for him.  
My lord, you do me shameful injury,  
Falsely to draw me in these vile suspects.

**GLOUCESTER**  
You may deny that you were not the cause  
Of my Lord Hastings' late imprisonment.

**RIVERS**  
She may, my lord, for--

**GLOUCESTER**  
She may, Lord Rivers! why, who knows not so?  
She may do more, sir, than denying that:  
She may help you to many fair preferments,  
And then deny her aiding hand therein,  
And lay those honors on your high deserts.  
What may she not? She may, yea, marry, may she--

**RIVERS**  
What, marry, may she?

**GLOUCESTER**  
What, marry, may she! marry with a king,  
A bachelor, a handsome stripling too:  
I wis your grandam had a worser match.

**QUEEN ELIZABETH**  
My Lord of Gloucester, I have too long borne  
Your blunt upbraidings and your bitter scoffs:  
By heaven, I will acquaint his majesty  
With those gross taunts I often have endured.  
I had rather be a country servant-maid  
Than a great queen, with this condition,  
To be thus taunted, scorn'd, and baited at:

*Enter QUEEN MARGARET, behind*

Small joy have I in being England's queen.

**QUEEN MARGARET**  
*\[Aside]*  
And lessen'd be that small, God, I beseech thee!  
Thy honour, state and seat is due to me.

**GLOUCESTER**  
What! threat you me with telling of the king?  
Tell him, and spare not: look, what I have said  
I will avouch in presence of the king:  
I dare adventure to be sent to the Tower.  
'Tis time to speak; my pains are quite forgot.

**QUEEN MARGARET**  
*\[Aside]*  
Out, devil! I remember them too well:  
Thou slewest my husband Henry in the Tower,  
And Edward, my poor son, at Tewksbury.

**GLOUCESTER**  
Ere you were queen, yea, or your husband king,  
I was a pack-horse in his great affairs;  
To royalize his blood I spilt mine own.  
Let me put in your mind, if you forget,  
What you have been ere now, and what you are;  
Withal, what I have been, and what I am.

**QUEEN MARGARET**  
*\[Aside]*  
A murderous villain, and so still thou art.  
Hie thee to hell for shame, and leave the world,  
Thou cacodemon! there thy kingdom is.

**RIVERS**  
My Lord of Gloucester, in those busy days  
Which here you urge to prove us enemies,  
We follow'd then our lord, our lawful king:  
So should we you, if you should be our king.

**GLOUCESTER**  
If I should be! I had rather be a pedlar:  
Far be it from my heart, the thought of it!

**QUEEN ELIZABETH**  
As little joy, my lord, as you suppose  
You should enjoy, were you this country's king,  
As little joy may you suppose in me.  
That I enjoy, being the queen thereof.

**QUEEN MARGARET**  
*\[Aside]*  
A little joy enjoys the queen thereof;  
For I am she, and altogether joyless.  
I can no longer hold me patient.

*\[Advancing]*  
Hear me, you wrangling pirates, that fall out  
In sharing that which you have pill'd from me!  
Which of you trembles not that looks on me?  
If not, that, I being queen, you bow like subjects,  
Yet that, by you deposed, you quake like rebels?  
O gentle villain, do not turn away!

**GLOUCESTER**  
Foul wrinkled witch, what makest thou in my sight?

**QUEEN MARGARET**  
But repetition of what thou hast marr'd;  
That will I make before I let thee go.

**GLOUCESTER**  
Wert thou not banished on pain of death?

**QUEEN MARGARET**  
I was; but I do find more pain in banishment  
Than death can yield me here by my abode.  
A husband and a son thou owest to me;  
And thou a kingdom; all of you allegiance:  
The sorrow that I have, by right is yours,  
And all the pleasures you usurp are mine.

**GLOUCESTER**  
The curse my noble father laid on thee,  
When thou didst crown his warlike brows with paper  
And with thy scorns drew'st rivers from his eyes,  
And then, to dry them, gavest the duke a clout  
Steep'd in the faultless blood of pretty Rutland--  
His curses, then from bitterness of soul  
Denounced against thee, are all fall'n upon thee;  
And God, not we, hath plagued thy bloody deed.

**QUEEN ELIZABETH**  
So just is God, to right the innocent.

**HASTINGS**  
O, 'twas the foulest deed to slay that babe,  
And the most merciless that e'er was heard of!

**RIVERS**  
Tyrants themselves wept when it was reported.

**BUCKINGHAM**  
Northumberland, then present, wept to see it.

**QUEEN MARGARET**  
What were you snarling all before I came,  
Ready to catch each other by the throat,  
And turn you all your hatred now on me?  
Did York's dread curse prevail so much with heaven?  
That Henry's death, my lovely Edward's death,  
Their kingdom's loss, my woful banishment,  
Could all but answer for that peevish brat?  
Can curses pierce the clouds and enter heaven?  
Why, then, give way, dull clouds, to my quick curses!  
If not by war, by surfeit die your king,  
As ours by murder, to make him a king!  
Edward thy son, which now is Prince of Wales,  
For Edward my son, which was Prince of Wales,  
Die in his youth by like untimely violence!  
Thyself a queen, for me that was a queen,  
Outlive thy glory, like my wretched self!  
Long mayst thou live to wail thy children's loss;  
And see another, as I see thee now,  
Deck'd in thy rights, as thou art stall'd in mine!  
Long die thy happy days before thy death;  
And, after many lengthen'd hours of grief,  
Die neither mother, wife, nor England's queen!  
Rivers, my lord, you were standing by,  
And so wast thou, Lord Hastings, when my son  
Was stabb'd with bloody daggers: God, I pray him,  
That both of you not live your natural age,  
But by some unlook'd accident cut off!

**GLOUCESTER**  
Have done thy charm, thou hateful wither'd hag!

**QUEEN MARGARET**  
And leave out thee? stay, dog, for thou shalt hear me.  
If heaven have any grievous plague in store  
Exceeding those that I can wish upon thee,  
O, let them keep it till thy sins be ripe,  
And then hurl down their indignation  
On thee, the troubler of the poor world's peace!  
The worm of conscience still begnaw thy soul!  
Thy friends suspect for traitors while thou livest,  
And take deep traitors for thy dearest friends!  
No sleep close up that deadly eye of thine,  
Unless it be whilst some tormenting dream  
Affrights thee with a hell of ugly devils!  
Thou that wast seal'd in thy nativity  
The slave of nature and the son of hell!  
Thou slander of thy mother's heavy womb!  
Thou loathed issue of thy father's loins!  
Thou rag of honor! thou detested--

**GLOUCESTER**  
Margaret. /

**QUEEN MARGARET**  
/ Richard! /

**GLOUCESTER**  
/ Ha! /

**QUEEN MARGARET**  
/ I call thee not.

**GLOUCESTER**  
I cry thee mercy then, for I had thought  
That thou hadst call'd me all these bitter names.

**QUEEN MARGARET**  
Why, so I did; but look'd for no reply.  
O, let me make the period to my curse!

**GLOUCESTER**  
'Tis done by me, and ends in 'Margaret.'

**QUEEN ELIZABETH**  
Thus have you breathed your curse against yourself.

**QUEEN MARGARET**  
Poor painted queen, vain flourish of my fortune!  
Why strew'st thou sugar on that bottled spider,  
Whose deadly web ensnareth thee about?  
Fool, fool! thou whet'st a knife to kill thyself.  
The time will come when thou shalt wish for me  
To help thee curse that poisonous bunchback'd toad.

**RIVERS**  
Dispute not with her; she is lunatic.

**BUCKINGHAM**  
Have done, have done.

**QUEEN MARGARET**  
O princely Buckingham I'll kiss thy hand,  
In sign of league and amity with thee:  
Now fair befall thee and thy noble house!  
Thy garments are not spotted with our blood,  
Nor thou within the compass of my curse.

**BUCKINGHAM**  
Nor no one here; for curses never pass  
The lips of those that breathe them in the air.

**QUEEN MARGARET**  
I'll not believe but they ascend the sky,  
And there awake God's gentle-sleeping peace.  
O Buckingham, take heed of yonder dog!  
Look, when he fawns, he bites; and when he bites,  
His venom tooth will rankle to the death:  
Have not to do with him, beware of him;  
Sin, death, and hell have set their marks on him,  
And all their ministers attend on him.

**GLOUCESTER**  
What doth she say, my Lord of Buckingham?

**BUCKINGHAM**  
Nothing that I respect, my gracious lord.

**QUEEN MARGARET**  
What, dost thou scorn me for my gentle counsel?  
And soothe the devil that I warn thee from?  
O, but remember this another day,  
When he shall split thy very heart with sorrow,  
And say poor Margaret was a prophetess!  
Live each of you the subjects to his hate,  
And he to yours, and all of you to God's!

*Exit*

**HASTINGS**  
My hair doth stand on end to hear her curses.

**RIVERS**  
And so doth mine: I muse why she's at liberty.

**GLOUCESTER**  
I cannot blame her: by God's holy mother,  
She hath had too much wrong; and I repent  
My part thereof that I have done to her.

*Enter CATESBY*

**CATESBY**  
Madam, his majesty doth call for you,  
And for your grace; and you, my noble lords.

**QUEEN ELIZABETH**  
Catesby, we come. Lords, will you go with us?

*Exeunt all but GLOUCESTER*

**GLOUCESTER**  
I do the wrong, and first begin to brawl.  
The secret mischiefs that I set abroach  
I lay unto the grievous charge of others.  
Clarence, whom I, indeed, have laid in darkness,  
I do beweep to many simple gulls  
Namely, to Hastings, Derby, Buckingham;  
And say it is the queen and her allies  
That stir the king against the duke my brother.  
Now, they believe it; and withal whet me  
To be revenged on Rivers forthwith:  
But then I sigh; and, with a piece of scripture,  
Tell them that God bids us do good for evil:  
And thus I clothe my naked villany  
With old odd ends stolen out of holy writ;  
And seem a saint, when most I play the devil.

*Enter a Murderer*

But, soft! here come my executioner.  
Are you now going to dispatch this deed?

**First Murderer**  
We are, my lord; and come to have the warrant  
That we may be admitted where he is.

**GLOUCESTER**  
Well thought upon; I have it here about me.

*\[Gives the warrant]*  
When you have done, repair to Crosby Place.  
But, sir, be sudden in the execution,  
Withal obdurate, do not hear him plead;  
For Clarence is well-spoken, and perhaps  
May move your hearts to pity if you mark him.

**First Murderer**  
Fear not, my lord, we will not stand to prate;  
Talkers are no good doers: be assured  
We come to use our hands and not our tongues.

**GLOUCESTER**  
Your eyes drop millstones, when fools' eyes drop tears:  
I like you, lad; about your business straight;  
Go, go, dispatch.

*Exeunt*

### SCENE IV. London. The Tower.

*Enter CLARENCE and BRAKENBURY*

**BRAKENBURY**  
Why looks your grace so heavily today?

**CLARENCE**  
O, I have pass'd a miserable night,  
So full of ugly sights, of ghastly dreams,  
I would not spend another such a night,  
Though 'twere to buy a world of happy days,  
So full of dismal terror was the time!

**BRAKENBURY**  
What was your dream? I long to hear you tell it.

**CLARENCE**  
Methoughts that I had broken from the Tower,  
And was embark'd to cross to Burgundy;  
And, in my company, my brother Gloucester;  
Who from my cabin tempted me to walk  
Upon the hatches: thence we looked toward England,  
And cited up a thousand fearful times,  
During the wars of York and Lancaster  
That had befall'n us. As we paced along  
Upon the giddy footing of the hatches,  
Methought that Gloucester stumbled; and, in falling,  
Struck me, that thought to stay him, overboard,  
Into the tumbling billows of the main.  
Lord, Lord! methought, what pain it was to drown!  
What dreadful noise of waters in mine ears!  
Methought I saw a thousand fearful wrecks;  
Ten thousand men that fishes gnaw'd upon;  
Wedges of gold, great anchors, heaps of pearl,  
All scatter'd in the bottom of the sea.

**BRAKENBURY**  
Had you such leisure in the time of death  
To gaze upon the secrets of the deep?

**CLARENCE**  
Methought I had; and often did I strive  
To yield the ghost: but still the envious flood  
Kept in my soul, and would not let it forth  
To seek the empty, vast and wandering air;  
But smother'd it within my panting bulk,  
Which almost burst to belch it in the sea.

**BRAKENBURY**  
Awaked you not with this sore agony?

**CLARENCE**  
O, no, my dream was lengthen'd after life;  
O, then began the tempest to my soul,  
Who pass'd, methought, the melancholy flood,  
Unto the kingdom of perpetual night.  
With that, methoughts, a legion of foul fiends  
Environ'd me about, and howled in mine ears  
Such hideous cries, that with the very noise  
I trembling waked, and for a season after  
Could not believe but that I was in hell,  
Such terrible impression made the dream.

**BRAKENBURY**  
No marvel, my lord, though it affrighted you;  
I promise, I am afraid to hear you tell it.

**CLARENCE**  
O God! if my deep prayers cannot appease thee,  
But thou wilt be avenged on my misdeeds,  
Yet execute thy wrath in me alone,  
O, spare my guiltless wife and my poor children!  
I pray thee, gentle keeper, stay by me;  
My soul is heavy, and I fain would sleep.

*CLARENCE sleeps*

*Enter two Murderers*

**First Murderer**  
Ho! who's here?

**BRAKENBURY**  
In God's name what are you, and how came you hither?

**First Murderer**  
I would speak with Clarence, and I came hither on my legs.

**BRAKENBURY**  
Yea, are you so brief?

**Second Murderer**  
O sir, it is better to be brief than tedious. Show  
him our commission; talk no more.

*BRAKENBURY reads it*

**BRAKENBURY**  
I am, in this, commanded to deliver  
The noble Duke of Clarence to your hands:  
I will not reason what is meant hereby,  
Because I will be guiltless of the meaning.  
Here are the keys, there sits the duke asleep:  
I'll to the king; and signify to him  
That thus I have resign'd my charge to you.

**First Murderer**  
Do so, it is a point of wisdom: fare you well.

*Exit BRAKENBURY*

**Second Murderer**  
What, shall we stab him as he sleeps?

**First Murderer**  
No; then he will say 'twas done cowardly, when he wakes.

**Second Murderer**  
When he wakes! why, fool, he shall never wake till  
the judgment-day.

**First Murderer**  
Why, then he will say we stabbed him sleeping.

**Second Murderer**  
The urging of that word 'judgment' hath bred a kind  
of remorse in me.

**First Murderer**  
What, art thou afraid?

**Second Murderer**  
Not to kill him, having a warrant for it; but to be  
damned for killing him, from which no warrant can defend us.

**First Murderer**  
I thought thou hadst been resolute.

**Second Murderer**  
So I am, to let him live.

**First Murderer**  
Back to the Duke of Gloucester, tell him so.

**Second Murderer**  
I pray thee, stay a while: I hope my holy humor  
will change; 'twas wont to hold me but while one  
would tell twenty.

**First Murderer**  
How dost thou feel thyself now?

**Second Murderer**  
'Faith, some certain dregs of conscience are yet  
within me.

**First Murderer**  
Remember our reward, when the deed is done.

**Second Murderer**  
'Zounds, he dies: I had forgot the reward.

**First Murderer**  
Where is thy conscience now?

**Second Murderer**  
In the Duke of Gloucester's purse.

**First Murderer**  
So when he opens his purse to give us our reward,  
thy conscience flies out.

**Second Murderer**  
Come, shall we to this gear?

**First Murderer**  
Take him over the costard with the hilts of thy  
sword, and then we will chop him in the malmsey-butt  
in the next room.

**Second Murderer**  
O excellent devise! make a sop of him.

**First Murderer**  
Hark! he stirs: shall I strike?

**Second Murderer**  
No, first let's reason with him.

**CLARENCE**  
Where art thou, keeper? give me a cup of wine.

**Second Murderer**  
You shall have wine enough, my lord, anon.

**CLARENCE**  
In God's name, what art thou?

**Second Murderer**  
A man, as you are.

**CLARENCE**  
Thy voice is thunder, but thy looks are humble.

**Second Murderer**  
My voice is now the king's, my looks mine own.

**CLARENCE**  
Your eyes do menace me: why look you pale?  
Who sent you hither? Wherefore do you come?

**First Murderer & Second Murderer**  
To, to, to--

**CLARENCE**  
To murder me?

**First Murderer & Second Murderer**  
Ay, ay.

**CLARENCE**  
You scarcely have the hearts to tell me so,  
And therefore cannot have the hearts to do it.  
Wherein, my friends, have I offended you?

**First Murderer**  
Offended us you have not, but the king.

**CLARENCE**  
I shall be reconciled to him again.

**Second Murderer**  
Never, my lord; therefore prepare to die.

**CLARENCE**  
Are you call'd forth from out a world of men  
To slay the innocent? What is my offence?

**First Murderer**  
What we will do, we do upon command.

**Second Murderer**  
And he that hath commanded is the king.

**First Murderer**  
Thy brother's love, our duty, and thy fault,  
Provoke us hither now to slaughter thee.

**CLARENCE**  
I am his brother, and I love him well.  
If you be hired for meed, go back again,  
And I will send you to my brother Gloucester,  
Who shall reward you better for my life  
Than Edward will for tidings of my death.

**Second Murderer**  
You are deceived, your brother Gloucester hates you.

**CLARENCE**  
O, no, he loves me, and he holds me dear:  
Go you to him from me.

**First Murderer & Second Murderer**  
Ay, so we will.

**CLARENCE**  
Tell him, when that our princely father York  
Bless'd his three sons with his victorious arm,  
And charged us from his soul to love each other,  
He little thought of this divided friendship:  
Bid Gloucester think of this, and he will weep.

**First Murderer**  
'Tis he that sent us hither now to slaughter thee.

**CLARENCE**  
It cannot be; for when I parted with him,  
He hugg'd me in his arms, and swore, with sobs,  
That he would labor my delivery.

**Second Murderer**  
Why, so he doth, now he delivers thee  
From this world's thraldom to the joys of heaven.

**First Murderer**  
Make peace with God, for you must die, my lord.

**CLARENCE**  
Hast thou that holy feeling in thy soul,  
To counsel me to make my peace with God,  
And art thou yet to thy own soul so blind,  
That thou wilt war with God by murdering me?  
Ah, sirs, consider, he that set you on  
To do this deed will hate you for the deed.

**Second Murderer**  
What shall we do?

**CLARENCE**  
Relent, and save your souls.

**First Murderer**  
Relent! 'tis cowardly and womanish.

**CLARENCE**  
Not to relent is beastly, savage, devilish.  
My friend, I spy some pity in thy looks:  
O, if thine eye be not a flatterer,  
Come thou on my side, and entreat for me,  
As you would beg, were you in my distress  
A begging prince what beggar pities not?

**Second Murderer**  
Look behind you, my lord.

**First Murderer**  
Take that, and that: if all this will not do,

*\[Stabs him]*  
I'll drown you in the malmsey-butt within.

*Exit, with the body*

**Second Murderer**  
A bloody deed, and desperately dispatch'd!

*Re-enter First Murderer*

**First Murderer**  
How now! what mean'st thou, that thou help'st me not?  
By heavens, the duke shall know how slack thou art!

**Second Murderer**  
I would he knew that I had saved his brother!  
Take thou the fee, and tell him what I say;  
For I repent me that the duke is slain.

*Exit*

**First Murderer**  
So do not I: go, coward as thou art.  
Now must I hide his body in some hole,  
Until the duke take order for his burial:  
And when I have my meed, I must away;  
For this will out, and here I must not stay.

*Exeunt*

## ACT II

### SCENE I. London. The palace.

*Flourish. Enter KING EDWARD IV sick, QUEEN ELIZABETH,
DORSET, RIVERS, HASTINGS, and. BUCKINGHAM*

**KING EDWARD IV**  
Why, so: now have I done a good day's work:  
You peers, continue this united league:  
I every day expect an embassage  
From my Redeemer to redeem me hence;  
And now in peace my soul shall part to heaven,  
Since I have set my friends at peace on earth.  
Rivers and Hastings, take each other's hand;  
Dissemble not your hatred, swear your love.

**RIVERS**  
By heaven, my heart is purged from grudging hate:  
And with my hand I seal my true heart's love.

**HASTINGS**  
So thrive I, as I truly swear the like!

**KING EDWARD IV**  
Take heed you dally not before your king;  
Lest he that is the supreme King of kings  
Confound your hidden falsehood, and award  
Either of you to be the other's end.

**HASTINGS**  
So prosper I, as I swear perfect love!

**RIVERS**  
And I, as I love Hastings with my heart!

**KING EDWARD IV**  
Madam, yourself are not exempt in this,  
Nor your son Dorset, Buckingham, nor you;  
You have been factious one against the other,  
Wife, love Lord Hastings, let him kiss your hand;  
And what you do, do it unfeignedly.

**QUEEN ELIZABETH**  
Here, Hastings; I will never more remember  
Our former hatred, so thrive I and mine!

**KING EDWARD IV**  
Dorset, embrace him; Hastings, love lord marquess.

**DORSET**  
This interchange of love, I here protest,  
Upon my part shall be unviolable.

**HASTINGS**  
And so swear I, my lord

*They embrace*

**KING EDWARD IV**  
Now, princely Buckingham, seal thou this league  
With thy embracements to my wife's allies,  
And make me happy in your unity.

**BUCKINGHAM**  
Whenever Buckingham doth turn his hate  
On you or yours, /

*\[To the Queen]*  
/ but with all duteous love  
Doth cherish you and yours, God punish me  
With hate in those where I expect most love!

**KING EDWARD IV**  
A pleasing cordial, princely Buckingham,  
is this thy vow unto my sickly heart.  
There wanteth now our brother Gloucester here,  
To make the perfect period of this peace.

**BUCKINGHAM**  
And, in good time, here comes the noble duke.

*Enter GLOUCESTER*

**GLOUCESTER**  
Good morrow to my sovereign king and queen:  
And, princely peers, a happy time of day!

**KING EDWARD IV**  
Happy, indeed, as we have spent the day.  
Brother, we done deeds of charity;  
Made peace enmity, fair love of hate,  
Between these swelling wrong-incensed peers.

**GLOUCESTER**  
A blessed labor, my most sovereign liege:  
Amongst this princely heap, if any here,  
Hold me a foe;  
If I unwittingly, or in my rage,  
Have aught committed that is hardly borne  
By any in this presence, I desire  
To reconcile me to his friendly peace:  
First, madam, I entreat true peace of you;  
Of you, my noble cousin Buckingham,  
If ever any grudge were lodged between us;  
Of you, Lord Rivers, and, Hastings, of you;  
Dukes, earls, lords, gentlemen; indeed, of all.

**QUEEN ELIZABETH**  
A holy day shall this be kept hereafter:  
I would to God all strifes were well compounded.  
My sovereign liege, I do beseech your majesty  
To take our brother Clarence to your grace.

**GLOUCESTER**  
Why, madam, have I offer'd love for this  
To be so bouted in this royal presence?  
Who knows not that the noble duke is dead?

*They all start*

You do him injury to scorn his corse.

**KING EDWARD IV**  
Is Clarence dead? the order was reversed.

**GLOUCESTER**  
But he, poor soul, by your first order died.

**KING EDWARD IV**  
My brother slew no man; his fault was thought,  
And yet his punishment was cruel death.  
Who sued to me for him? who, in my rage,  
Kneel'd at my feet, and bade me be advised?  
Who spake of brotherhood? who spake of love?  
Who told me, when we both lay in the field  
Frozen almost to death, how he did lap me  
Even in his own garments, and gave himself,  
All thin and naked, to the numb cold night?  
O God, I fear thy justice will take hold  
On me, and you, and mine, and yours for this!  
Come, Hastings, help me to my closet.  
Oh, poor Clarence!

*Exeunt all but GLOUCESTER and BUCKINGHAM*

**GLOUCESTER**  
This is the fruit of rashness! Mark'd you not  
How that the guilty kindred of the queen  
Look'd pale when they did hear of Clarence' death?  
God will revenge it. But come, let us in,  
To comfort Edward with our company.

**BUCKINGHAM**  
We wait upon your grace.

*Exeunt*

### SCENE II. The palace.

*Discover the DUCHESS OF YORK, in mourning. Enter QUEEN
ELIZABETH, with her hair about her ears; and DORSET after
her*

**QUEEN ELIZABETH**  
Oh, who shall hinder me to wail and weep,  
To chide my fortune, and torment myself?  
I'll join with black despair against my soul,  
And to myself become an enemy.

**DUCHESS OF YORK**  
What means this scene of rude impatience?

**QUEEN ELIZABETH**  
To make an act of tragic violence:  
Edward, my lord, your son, our king, is dead.

**DUCHESS OF YORK**  
Ah, so much interest have I in thy sorrow  
As I had title in thy noble husband!  
I have bewept a worthy husband's death,  
And lived by looking on his images:  
But now two mirrors of his princely semblance  
Are crack'd in pieces by malignant death,  
And I for comfort have but one false glass,  
Which grieves me when I see my shame in him.

**QUEEN ELIZABETH**  
Give me no help in lamentation;  
I am not barren to bring forth complaints  
All springs reduce their currents to mine eyes,  
That I, being govern'd by the watery moon,  
May send forth plenteous tears to drown the world!  
Oh for my husband, for my dear lord Edward!

**DUCHESS OF YORK**  
Alas for both, both mine, Edward and Clarence!

**QUEEN ELIZABETH**  
What stay had I but Edward? and he's gone.

**DUCHESS OF YORK**  
What stays had I but they? and they are gone.

**QUEEN ELIZABETH**  
Was never widow had so dear a loss!

**DUCHESS OF YORK**  
Was never mother had so dear a loss!  
Alas, I am the mother of these moans!  
Their woes are parcell'd, mine are general.  
She for an Edward weeps, and so do I;  
I for a Clarence weep, so doth not she!

**DORSET**  
Madam, bethink you, like a careful mother,  
Of the young prince your son: send straight for him  
Let him be crown'd; in him your comfort lives:  
Drown desperate sorrow in dead Edward's grave,  
And plant your joys in living Edward's throne.

*Enter GLOUCESTER, BUCKINGHAM, and HASTINGS*

**GLOUCESTER**  
Madam, have comfort: all of us have cause  
To wail the dimming of our shining star;  
But none can cure their harms by wailing them.  
Madam, my mother, I do cry you mercy.

**DUCHESS OF YORK**  
God bless thee; and put meekness in thy mind,  
Love, charity, obedience, and true duty!

**BUCKINGHAM**  
You cloudy princes and heart-sorrowing peers,  
That bear this mutual heavy load of moan,  
Now cheer each other in each other's love  
Though we have spent our harvest of this king,  
We are to reap the harvest of his son.  
Me seemeth good, that, with some little train,  
Forthwith from Ludlow the young prince be fetch'd  
Hither to London, to be crown'd our king.

**DORSET**  
Why with some little train, my Lord of Buckingham?

**BUCKINGHAM**  
Marry, my lord, lest, by a multitude,  
The new-heal'd wound of malice should break out,  
Which would be so much the more dangerous  
By how much the estate is green and yet ungovern'd.

**GLOUCESTER**  
I hope the king made peace with all of us  
And the compact is firm and true in me.

**DORSET**  
And so in me; and so, I think, in all:  
Yet, since it is but green, it should be put  
To no apparent likelihood of breach,  
Which haply by much company might be urged:  
Therefore I say with noble Buckingham,  
That it is meet so few should fetch the prince.

**HASTINGS**  
And so say I.

**GLOUCESTER**  
Then be it so; and go we to determine  
Who they shall be that straight shall post to Ludlow.  
Madam, and you, my mother, will you go  
To give your censures in this weighty business?

**QUEEN ELIZABETH & DUCHESS OF YORK**  
With all our hearts.

*Exeunt all but BUCKINGHAM and GLOUCESTER*

**BUCKINGHAM**  
My lord, whoever journeys to the Prince,  
For God's sake, let not us two be behind;  
For, by the way, I'll sort occasion,  
As index to the story we late talk'd of,  
To part the queen's proud kindred from the king.

**GLOUCESTER**  
My other self, my counsel's consistory,  
My oracle, my prophet! My dear cousin,  
I, like a child, will go by thy direction.  
Towards Ludlow then, for we'll not stay behind.

*Exeunt*

### SCENE IV. London. The palace.

*Enter the young YORK, QUEEN ELIZABETH, and the DUCHESS OF
YORK*

**DUCHESS OF YORK**  
I long with all my heart to see the prince:  
I hope he is much grown since last I saw him.

**QUEEN ELIZABETH**  
But I hear, no; they say my son of York  
Hath almost overta'en him in his growth.

**YORK**  
Ay, mother; but I would not have it so.

**DUCHESS OF YORK**  
Why, my young cousin, it is good to grow.

**YORK**  
Grandam, one night, as we did sit at supper,  
My uncle Rivers talk'd how I did grow  
More than my brother: 'Ay,' quoth my uncle Gloucester,  
'Small herbs have grace, great weeds do grow apace:'  
And since, methinks, I would not grow so fast,  
Because sweet flowers are slow and weeds make haste.

**DUCHESS OF YORK**  
Good faith, good faith, the saying did not hold  
In him that did object the same to thee;  
He was the wretched'st thing when he was young,  
So long a-growing and so leisurely,  
That, if this rule were true, he should be gracious.

**YORK**  
Now, by my troth, if I had been remember'd,  
I could have given my uncle's grace a flout,  
To touch his growth nearer than he touch'd mine.

**DUCHESS OF YORK**  
How, my pretty York? I pray thee, let me hear it.

**YORK**  
Marry, they say my uncle grew so fast  
That he could gnaw a crust at two hours old  
'Twas full two years ere I could get a tooth.  
Grandam, this would have been a biting jest.

*Enter a Messenger*

**QUEEN ELIZABETH**  
How fares the prince? /

**Messenger**  
/ Well, madam, and in health.

**DUCHESS OF YORK**  
What is thy news then?

**Messenger**  
Lord Rivers is sent straight to Pomfret, --

**DUCHESS OF YORK**  
Who hath committed him? /

**Messenger**  
/ The mighty dukes  
Gloucester and Buckingham. /

**QUEEN ELIZABETH**  
/ For what offence?

**Messenger**  
The sum of all I can, I have disclosed;  
Why or for what this noble was committed  
Is all unknown to me, my gracious lady.

**QUEEN ELIZABETH**  
Ay me, I see the downfall of our house!  
Welcome, destruction, death, and massacre!  
I see, as in a map, the end of all.

**DUCHESS OF YORK**  
Accursed and unquiet wrangling days,  
How many of you have mine eyes beheld!

**QUEEN ELIZABETH**  
Come, come, my boy; we will to sanctuary.  
Madam, farewell. /

**DUCHESS OF YORK**  
/ I'll go along with you.

*Exeunt*

## ACT III

### SCENE I. London. Another street.

*The trumpets sound. Enter the young PRINCE EDWARD,
GLOUCESTER, BUCKINGHAM, CARDINAL, and CATESBY*

**BUCKINGHAM**  
Welcome, sweet prince, to London, to your chamber.

**GLOUCESTER**  
Welcome, dear cousin, my thoughts' sovereign.  
The weary way hath made you melancholy.

**PRINCE EDWARD**  
No, uncle; but our crosses on the way  
Have made it tedious, wearisome, and heavy.  
I want more uncles here to welcome me.

**GLOUCESTER**  
Those uncles which you want were dangerous;  
Your grace attended to their sugar'd words,  
But look'd not on the poison of their hearts :  
God keep you from them, and from such false friends!

**PRINCE EDWARD**  
God keep me from false friends! but they were none.  
I thought my mother, and my brother York,  
Would long ere this have met us on the way  
Fie, what a slug is Hastings, that he comes not  
To tell us whether they will come or no!

*Enter HASTINGS*

**BUCKINGHAM**  
And, in good time, here comes the sweating lord.

**PRINCE EDWARD**  
Welcome, my lord: what, will our mother come?

**HASTINGS**  
On what occasion, God he knows, not I,  
The queen your mother, and your brother York,  
Have taken sanctuary: the tender prince  
Would fain have come with me to meet your grace,  
But by his mother was perforce withheld.

**BUCKINGHAM**  
Fie, what an indirect and peevish course  
Is this of hers! Lord cardinal, will your grace  
Persuade the queen to send the Duke of York  
Unto his princely brother presently?  
If she deny, Lord Hastings, go with him,  
And from her jealous arms pluck him perforce.

**CARDINAL**  
My Lord of Buckingham, if my weak oratory  
Can from his mother win the Duke of York,  
Anon expect him here; but if she be obdurate  
To mild entreaties, God in heaven forbid  
We should infringe the holy privilege  
Of blessed sanctuary! not for all this land  
Would I be guilty of so deep a sin.

**BUCKINGHAM**  
You are too senseless--obstinate, my lord,  
Too ceremonious and traditional.  
Weigh it but with the grossness of this age,  
You break not sanctuary in seizing him.  
The benefit thereof is always granted  
To those whose dealings have deserved the place,  
And those who have the wit to claim the place:  
This prince hath neither claim'd it nor deserved it;  
And therefore, in mine opinion, cannot have it:  
Then, taking him from thence that is not there,  
You break no privilege nor charter there.

**CARDINAL**  
My lord, you shall o'er-rule my mind for once.  
Come on, Lord Hastings, will you go with me?

**PRINCE EDWARD**  
Good lords, make all the speedy haste you may.

*Exeunt CARDINAL and HASTINGS*

Say, uncle Gloucester, if our brother come,  
Where shall we sojourn till our coronation?

**GLOUCESTER**  
Where it seems best unto your royal self.  
If I may counsel you, some day or two  
Your highness shall repose you at the Tower.

**PRINCE EDWARD**  
I do not like the Tower, of any place.  
Did Julius Caesar build that place, my lord?

**BUCKINGHAM**  
He did, my gracious lord, begin that place;  
Which, since, succeeding ages have re-edified.

**PRINCE EDWARD**  
Is it upon record, or else reported  
Successively from age to age, he built it?

**BUCKINGHAM**  
Upon record, my gracious lord.

**PRINCE EDWARD**  
But say, my lord, it were not register'd,  
Methinks the truth should live from age to age,  
As 'twere retail'd to all posterity,  
Even to the general all-ending day.

**GLOUCESTER**  
*\[Aside]*  
So wise so young, they say, do never live long.

**PRINCE EDWARD**  
What say you, uncle?

**GLOUCESTER**  
I say, without characters, fame lives long.

*\[Aside]*  
Thus, like the formal vice, Iniquity,  
I moralize two meanings in one word.

**PRINCE EDWARD**  
That Julius Caesar was a famous man;  
With what his valor did enrich his wit,  
His wit set down to make his valor live  
Death makes no conquest of this conqueror;  
For now he lives in fame, though not in life.  
I'll tell you what, my cousin Buckingham,--

**BUCKINGHAM**  
What, my gracious lord?

**PRINCE EDWARD**  
An if I live until I be a man,  
I'll win our ancient right in France again,  
Or die a soldier, as I lived a king.

**GLOUCESTER**  
*\[Aside]*  
Short summers lightly have a forward spring.

*Enter young YORK, HASTINGS, and the CARDINAL*

**BUCKINGHAM**  
Now, in good time, here comes the Duke of York.

**PRINCE EDWARD**  
Richard of York! how fares our loving brother?

**YORK**  
Well, my dread lord; so must I call you now.

**PRINCE EDWARD**  
Ay, brother, to our grief, as it is yours:  
Too late he died that might have kept that title,  
Which by his death hath lost much majesty.

**GLOUCESTER**  
How fares our cousin, noble Lord of York?

**YORK**  
I thank you, gentle uncle. O, my lord,  
You said that idle weeds are fast in growth  
The prince my brother hath outgrown me far.

**GLOUCESTER**  
He hath, my lord. /

**YORK**  
/ And therefore is he idle?

**GLOUCESTER**  
O, my fair cousin, I must not say so.

**YORK**  
Then is he more beholding to you than I.

**GLOUCESTER**  
He may command me as my sovereign;  
But you have power in me as in a kinsman.

**YORK**  
I pray you, uncle, give me this dagger.

**GLOUCESTER**  
My dagger, little cousin? with all my heart.

**PRINCE EDWARD**  
A beggar, brother?

**YORK**  
Of my kind uncle, that I know will give;  
And being but a toy, which is no grief to give.

**GLOUCESTER**  
A greater gift than that I'll give my cousin.

**YORK**  
A greater gift! O, that's the sword to it.

**GLOUCESTER**  
A gentle cousin, were it light enough.

**YORK**  
O, then, I see, you will part but with light gifts;  
In weightier things you'll say a beggar nay.

**GLOUCESTER**  
It is too heavy for your grace to wear.

**YORK**  
I weigh it lightly, were it heavier.

**GLOUCESTER**  
What, would you have my weapon, little lord?

**YORK**  
I would, that I might thank you as you call me.

**GLOUCESTER**  
How?

**YORK**  
Little.

**PRINCE EDWARD**  
My Lord of York will still be cross in talk:  
Uncle, your grace knows how to bear with him.

**YORK**  
You mean, to bear me, not to bear with me:  
Uncle, my brother mocks both you and me;  
Because that I am little, like an ape,  
He thinks that you should bear me on your shoulders.

**GLOUCESTER**  
My lord, will't please you pass along?  
Myself and my good cousin Buckingham  
Will to your mother, to entreat of her  
To meet you at the Tower and welcome you.

**YORK**  
What, will you go unto the Tower, my lord?

**PRINCE EDWARD**  
My lord protector needs will have it so.

**YORK**  
I shall not sleep in quiet at the Tower.

**GLOUCESTER**  
Why, what should you fear?

**YORK**  
Marry, my uncle Clarence' angry ghost:  
My grandam told me he was murdered there.

**PRINCE EDWARD**  
I fear no uncles dead.

**GLOUCESTER**  
Nor none that live, I hope.

**PRINCE EDWARD**  
An if they live, I hope I need not fear.  
But come, my lord; and with a heavy heart,  
Thinking on them, go I unto the Tower.

*A Sennet. Exeunt all but GLOUCESTER, BUCKINGHAM and CATESBY*

**BUCKINGHAM**  
Think you, my lord, this little prating York  
Was not incensed by his subtle mother  
To taunt and scorn you thus opprobriously?

**GLOUCESTER**  
No doubt, no doubt; O, 'tis a parlous boy;  
Bold, quick, ingenious, forward, capable  
He is all the mother's, from the top to toe.

**BUCKINGHAM**  
Well, let them rest. Come hither, Catesby.  
Thou art sworn as deeply to effect what we intend  
As closely to conceal what we impart:  
Thou know'st our reasons urged upon the way;  
What think'st thou? is it not an easy matter  
To make William Lord Hastings of our mind,  
For the instalment of this noble duke  
In the seat royal of this famous isle?

**CATESBY**  
He for his father's sake so loves the prince,  
That he will not be won to aught against him.

**BUCKINGHAM**  
Well, then, no more but this: go, gentle Catesby,  
And, as it were far off sound thou Lord Hastings,  
And summon him tomorrow to the Tower,  
To sit about the coronation.  
If thou dost find him tractable to us,  
Encourage him, and show him all our reasons:  
If he be leaden, icy-cold, unwilling,  
Be thou so too; and so break off your talk,  
And give us notice of his inclination:  
For we tomorrow hold divided councils,  
Wherein thyself shalt highly be employ'd.

**CATESBY**  
My good lords both, with all the heed I may.

**GLOUCESTER**  
Shall we hear from you, Catesby, ere we sleep?

**CATESBY**  
You shall, my lord.

**GLOUCESTER**  
At Crosby Place, there shall you find us both.

*Exit CATESBY*

**BUCKINGHAM**  
Now, my lord, what shall we do, if we perceive  
Lord Hastings will not yield to our complots?

**GLOUCESTER**  
Chop off his head, man; somewhat we will do:  
And, look, when I am king, claim thou of me  
The earldom of Hereford, and the moveables  
Whereof the king my brother stood possess'd.

**BUCKINGHAM**  
I'll claim that promise at your grace's hands.

**GLOUCESTER**  
And look to have it yielded with all willingness.  
Come, let us sup betimes, that afterwards  
We may digest our complots in some form.

*Exeunt*

### SCENE II. Before Lord Hastings' house.

*Enter CATESBY*

**HASTINGS**  
Good morrow, Catesby; you are early stirring  
What news, what news, in this our tottering state?

**CATESBY**  
It is a reeling world, indeed, my lord;  
And I believe twill never stand upright  
Till Richard wear the garland of the realm.

**HASTINGS**  
How! wear the garland! dost thou mean the crown?

**CATESBY**  
Ay, my good lord.

**HASTINGS**  
I'll have this crown of mine cut from my shoulders  
Ere I will see the crown so foul misplaced.  
But canst thou guess that he doth aim at it?

**CATESBY**  
Ay, on my life; and hopes to find forward  
Upon his party for the gain thereof:  
And thereupon he sends you this good news,  
That this same very day your enemy,  
The kindred of the queen, must die at Pomfret.

**HASTINGS**  
Indeed, I am no mourner for that news,  
Because he has been still mine enemy:  
But, that I'll give my voice on Richard's side,  
To bar my master's heirs in true descent,  
God knows I will not do it, to the death.
But I shall laugh at this a twelve-month hence,  
That they who brought me in my master's hate  
I live to look upon their tragedy.

*Enter BUCKINGHAM*

Buckingham! What, go you toward the Tower?

**BUCKINGHAM**  
I do, my lord; but long I shall not stay  
I shall return before your lordship thence.

**HASTINGS**  
'Tis like enough, for I stay dinner there.

**BUCKINGHAM**  
*\[Aside]*  
And supper too, although thou know'st it not.  
Come, will you go? /

**HASTINGS**  
/ I'll wait upon your lordship.

*Exeunt*

### SCENE III. Pomfret Castle.

*Enter RATCLIFF, carrying RIVERS to death*

**RIVERS**  
Sir Richard Ratcliff, let me tell thee this:  
Today shalt thou behold a subject die  
For truth, for duty, and for loyalty.

**RATCLIFF**  
Dispatch; the limit of your life is out.

**RIVERS**  
O Pomfret, Pomfret! O thou bloody prison,  
Fatal and ominous to noble peers!  
Now Margaret's curse is fall'n upon my head,  
For standing by when Richard stabb'd her son.  
Then cursed she Hastings, then cursed she Buckingham,  
Then cursed she Richard. O, remember, God  
To hear her prayers for them, as now for me,  
And for my sister and her princely sons,  
Be satisfied, dear God, with my true blood,  
Which, as thou know'st, unjustly must be spilt.

**RATCLIFF**  
Make haste; the hour of death is expiate.

*Exeunt*

### SCENE IV. The Tower of London.

*Enter BUCKINGHAM, DERBY, HASTINGS, and RATCLIFF, who take
their seats at a table*

**HASTINGS**  
My lords, at once: the cause why we are met  
Is, to determine of the coronation.  
In God's name, speak: when is the royal day?

**BUCKINGHAM**  
Are all things fitting for that royal time?

**DERBY**  
It is, and wants but nomination.

**HASTINGS**  
Tomorrow, then, I judge a happy day.

**BUCKINGHAM**  
Who knows the lord protector's mind herein?  
Who is most inward with the royal duke?  
Lord Hastings, you and he are near in love.

**HASTINGS**  
I thank his grace, I know he loves me well;  
But, for his purpose in the coronation.  
I have not sounded him, nor he deliver'd  
His gracious pleasure any way therein:  
But you, my noble lords, may name the time;  
And in the duke's behalf I'll give my voice,  
Which, I presume, he'll take in gentle part.

*Enter GLOUCESTER*

**DERBY**  
Now in good time, here comes the duke himself.

**GLOUCESTER**  
My noble lords and cousins all, good morrow.  
I have been long a sleeper; but, I hope,  
My absence doth neglect no great designs,  
Which by my presence might have been concluded.

**BUCKINGHAM**  
Had not you come upon your cue, my lord  
William Lord Hastings had pronounced your part,--  
I mean, your voice,--for crowning of the king.

**GLOUCESTER**  
Than my Lord Hastings no man might be bolder;  
His lordship knows me well, and loves me well.

**HASTINGS**  
I thank your grace.

**GLOUCESTER**  
Cousin of Buckingham, a word with you.

*\[Drawing him aside]*  
Catesby hath sounded Hastings in our business,  
And finds the testy gentleman so hot,  
As he will lose his head ere give consent  
His master's son, as worshipful as he terms it,  
Shall lose the royalty of England's throne.

**BUCKINGHAM**  
Withdraw you hence, my lord, I'll follow you.

*Exit GLOUCESTER, BUCKINGHAM following*

**DERBY**  
We have not yet set down this day of triumph.  
Tomorrow, in mine opinion, is too sudden;  
For I myself am not so well provided  
As else I would be, were the day prolong'd.

**HASTINGS**  
His grace looks cheerfully and smooth today;  
There's some conceit or other likes him well,  
When he doth bid good morrow with such a spirit.  
I think there's never a man in Christendom  
That can less hide his love or hate than he;  
For by his face straight shall you know his heart.

**DERBY**  
What of his heart perceive you in his face  
By any likelihood he show'd today?

**HASTINGS**  
Marry, that with no man here he is offended;  
For, were he, he had shown it in his looks.

**DERBY**  
I pray God he be not, I say.

*Re-enter GLOUCESTER and BUCKINGHAM*

**GLOUCESTER**  
I pray you all, tell me what they deserve  
That do conspire my death with devilish plots  
Of damned witchcraft, and that have prevail'd  
Upon my body with their hellish charms?

**HASTINGS**  
The tender love I bear your grace, my lord,  
Makes me most forward in this noble presence  
To doom the offenders, whatsoever they be  
I say, my lord, they have deserved death.

**GLOUCESTER**  
Then be your eyes the witness of this ill:  
See how I am bewitch'd; behold mine arm  
Is, like a blasted sapling, wither'd up:  
And this is Edward's wife, that monstrous witch,  
Consorted with that harlot strumpet Shore,  
That by their witchcraft thus have marked me.

**HASTINGS**  
If they have done this thing, my gracious lord--

**GLOUCESTER**  
If? Thou protector of this damned strumpet--  
Tellest thou me of 'ifs'? Thou art a traitor:  
Off with his head! Now, by Saint Paul I swear,  
I will not dine until I see the same.  
Here, my good Ratcliff, look that it be done:  
The rest, that love me, rise and follow me.

*Exeunt all but HASTINGS and RATCLIFF*

**HASTINGS**  
O Margaret, Margaret, now thy heavy curse  
Is lighted on poor Hastings' wretched head!

**RATCLIFF**  
Dispatch, my lord; the duke would be at dinner:  
Make a short shrift; he longs to see your head.

**HASTINGS**  
O bloody Richard! miserable England!  
I prophesy the fearful'st time to thee  
That ever wretched age hath look'd upon.  
Come, lead me to the block; bear him my head.  
They smile at me that shortly shall be dead.

*Exeunt*

### SCENE V. The Tower-walls.

*Enter GLOUCESTER and BUCKINGHAM, in rotten armour, marvellous ill-favoured*

**GLOUCESTER**  
Come, cousin, canst thou quake, and change thy colour,  
Murder thy breath in the middle of a word,  
And then begin again, and stop again,  
As if thou wert distraught and mad with terror?

**BUCKINGHAM**  
Tut, I can counterfeit the deep tragedian!  
But what, is Catesby gone?

**GLOUCESTER**  
He is; and, see, he brings the mayor along.

*Enter the Lord Mayor and CATESBY*

**BUCKINGHAM**  
God and our innocency defend and guard us!

**GLOUCESTER**  
Be patient, tis a friend, Ratcliff, not foe.

*Enter RATCLIFF, with HASTINGS' head*

**RATCLIFF**  
Here is the head of that ignoble traitor,  
The dangerous and unsuspected Hastings.

**GLOUCESTER**  
So dear I loved the man, that I must weep.  
I took him for the plainest harmless creature  
That breathed upon this earth a Christian.

**BUCKINGHAM**  
Well, well, he was the covert'st shelter'd traitor  
That ever lived.  
Would you imagine, or almost believe,  
Were't not that, by great preservation,  
We live to tell it you, the subtle traitor  
This day had plotted, in the council-house  
To murder me and my good Lord of Gloucester?

**Lord Mayor**  
What, had he so?

**GLOUCESTER**  
What, think You we are Turks or infidels?  
Or that we would, against the form of law,  
Proceed thus rashly to the villain's death,  
But that the extreme peril of the case,  
The peace of England and our persons' safety,  
Enforced us to this execution?

**Lord Mayor**  
Now, fair befall you! he deserved his death;  
And you my good lords, both have well proceeded,  
To warn false traitors from the like attempts.

**GLOUCESTER**  
Yet had not we determined he should die,  
Until your lordship came to see his death;  
Which now the loving haste of this our friend,  
Somewhat against our meaning, hath prevented:  
Because, my lord, we would have had you heard  
The traitor speak, and timorously confess  
The manner and the purpose of his treason.

**Lord Mayor**  
But, my good lord, your grace's word shall serve,  
As well as I had seen and heard him speak  
And doubt you not, right noble princes both,  
But I'll acquaint our duteous citizens  
With all your just proceedings in this cause.

**GLOUCESTER**  
And to that end we wish'd your lordship here,  
To avoid the carping censures of the world.

**BUCKINGHAM**  
But since you come too late of our intents,  
Yet witness what you hear we did intend:  
And so, my good lord mayor, we bid farewell.

*Exit Lord Mayor*

**GLOUCESTER**  
Go, after, after, cousin Buckingham.  
The mayor towards Guildhall hies him in all post:  
There, at your meet'st advantage of the time,  
Infer the bastardy of Edward's children:  
Tell them how Edward put to death a citizen,  
Only for saying he would make his son  
Heir to the crown; meaning indeed his house,  
Tell them, when that my mother went with child  
Of that unsatiate Edward, noble York  
My princely father then had wars in France  
And, by just computation of the time,  
Found that the issue was not his begot;  
Which well appeared in his lineaments,  
Being nothing like the noble duke my father:  
But touch this sparingly, as 'twere far off,  
Because you know, my lord, my mother lives.  
If you thrive well, bring them to Baynard's Castle;  
Where you shall find me well accompanied  
With reverend fathers and well-learned bishops.

**BUCKINGHAM**  
I go: and towards three or four o'clock  
Look for the news that the Guildhall affords.

*Exeunt all but GLOUCESTER*

**GLOUCESTER**  
Now will I in, to take some privy order,  
To draw the brats of Clarence out of sight;  
And to give notice, that no manner of person  
At any time have recourse unto the princes.

*Exit*

### SCENE VII. Baynard's Castle.

*Enter GLOUCESTER and BUCKINGHAM, at several doors*

**GLOUCESTER**  
How now, my lord, what say the citizens?

**BUCKINGHAM**  
Now, by the holy mother of our Lord,  
The citizens are mum and speak not a word.

**GLOUCESTER**  
Touch'd you the bastardy of Edward's children?

**BUCKINGHAM**  
I did; with his contract with Lady Lucy,  
And his contract by deputy in France;  
As being got, your father then in France,  
His resemblance, being not like the duke;  
Withal I did infer your lineaments,  
Being the right idea of your father,  
Both in your form and nobleness of mind;  
And when mine oratory grew to an end  
I bid them that did love their country's good  
Cry 'God save Richard, England's royal king!'

**GLOUCESTER**  
Ah! and did they so?

**BUCKINGHAM**  
No, so God help me, they spake not a word;  
But, like dumb statues or breathing stones,  
Gazed each on other, and look'd deadly pale.  
The mayor is here at hand: intend some fear;  
Be not you spoke with, but by mighty suit:  
And look you get a prayer-book in your hand,  
For on that ground I'll build a holy descant:  
And be not easily won to our request:  
Play the maid's part, still answer nay, and take it.

**GLOUCESTER**  
I go; and if you plead as well for them  
As I can say nay to thee for myself,  
No doubt well bring it to a happy issue.

**BUCKINGHAM**  
Go, go, up to the leads; the lord mayor knocks.

*Exit GLOUCESTER*

*Enter the Lord Mayor*

Welcome my lord; I dance attendance here;  
I think the duke will not be spoke withal.

*Enter CATESBY*

Here comes his servant: how now, Catesby,  
What says he?

**CATESBY**  
He is within, with two right reverend fathers,  
Divinely bent to meditation;  
And no worldly suit would he be moved,  
To draw him from his holy exercise.

**BUCKINGHAM**  
Return, good Catesby, to thy lord again;  
Tell him, myself, the mayor and citizens,  
In deep designs and matters of great moment,  
No less importing than our general good,  
Are come to have some conference with his grace.

*Exit*

Ah, ha, my lord, this prince is not an Edward!  
He is not lolling on a lewd day-bed,  
But on his knees at meditation;  
Not sleeping, to engross his idle body,  
But praying, to enrich his watchful soul:  
Happy were England, would this gracious prince  
Take on himself the sovereignty thereof:  
But, sure, I fear, we shall ne'er win him to it.

**Lord Mayor**  
Marry, God forbid his grace should say us nay!

**BUCKINGHAM**  
I fear he will.

*Re-enter CATESBY*

How now, Catesby, what says your lord? /

**CATESBY**  
/ My lord,  
He wonders to what end you have assembled  
Such troops of citizens to speak with him,  
His grace not being warn'd thereof before:  
My lord, he fears you mean no good to him.

**BUCKINGHAM**  
By heaven, I come in perfect love to him;  
And so once more return and tell his grace.

*Exit CATESBY*

When holy and devout religious men  
Are at their beads, 'tis hard to draw them thence,  
So sweet is zealous contemplation.

*Enter GLOUCESTER aloft*

Famous Plantagenet, most gracious prince,  
Lend favourable ears to our request.

**GLOUCESTER**  
My lord, there needs no such apology:  
I rather do beseech you pardon me,  
Who, earnest in the service of my God,  
Neglect the visitation of my friends.  
I do suspect I have done some offence  
That seems disgracious in the city's eyes,  
And that you come to reprehend my ignorance.

**BUCKINGHAM**  
You have, my lord: would it might please your grace,  
At our entreaties, to amend that fault!

**GLOUCESTER**  
Else wherefore breathe I in a Christian land?

**BUCKINGHAM**  
Then know, it is your fault that you resign  
The supreme seat, the throne majestical,  
To the corruption of a blemished stock:  
Whilst, in the mildness of your sleepy thoughts,  
This noble isle doth want her proper limbs;  
Which to recure, we heartily solicit  
Your gracious self to take on you the charge  
And kingly government of this your land,  
Not as protector, steward, substitute,  
Or lowly factor for another's gain;  
But as successively from blood to blood,  
Your right of birth, your empery, your own.

**GLOUCESTER**  
I know not whether to depart in silence,  
Or bitterly to speak in your reproof.  
First if all obstacles were cut away,  
And that my path were even to the crown,  
As my ripe revenue and due by birth  
Yet so much is my poverty of spirit,  
So mighty and so many my defects,  
But, God be thank'd, there's no need of me,  
And much I need to help you, if need were;  
The royal tree hath left us royal fruit.

**BUCKINGHAM**  
You say that Edward is your brother's son:  
So say we too, but not by Edward's wife;  
For first he was contract to Lady Lucy--  
Your mother lives a witness to that vow--  
And afterward by substitute betroth'd  
To Bona, sister to the King of France.  
By her, in his unlawful bed, he got  
This Edward, whom our manners term the prince.  
Then, good my lord, take to your royal self  
This proffer'd benefit of dignity.

**Lord Mayor**  
Do, good my lord, your citizens entreat you.

**BUCKINGHAM**  
Refuse not, mighty lord, this proffer'd love.  
O, make them joyful, grant their lawful suit!

**GLOUCESTER**  
Alas, why would you heap these cares on me?  
I am unfit for state and majesty;  
I do beseech you, take it not amiss;  
I cannot nor I will not yield to you.

**BUCKINGHAM**  
If you refuse it,--as, in love and zeal,  
Loath to depose the child, Your brother's son;  
Yet whether you accept our suit or no,  
Your brother's son shall never reign our king;  
But we will plant some other in the throne,  
To the disgrace and downfall of your house:  
And in this resolution here we leave you.--

*Exit BUCKINGHAM*

**Lord Mayor**  
Call them again, my lord, and accept their suit.

**GLOUCESTER**  
Would you enforce me to a world of care?

*Re-enter BUCKINGHAM and the rest*

Cousin of Buckingham, and you sage, grave men,  
Since you will buckle fortune on my back,  
To bear her burthen, whether I will or no,  
I must have patience to endure the load:  
But if black scandal or foul-faced reproach  
Attend the sequel of your imposition,  
Your mere enforcement shall acquittance me  
From all the impure blots and stains thereof;  
For God he knows, and you may partly see,  
How far I am from the desire thereof.

**Lord Mayor**  
God bless your grace! we see it, and will say it.

**GLOUCESTER**  
In saying so, you shall but say the truth.

**BUCKINGHAM**  
Then I salute you with this kingly title:  
Long live Richard, England's royal king! /

**Lord Mayor**  
/ Amen.

**BUCKINGHAM**  
Tomorrow will it please you to be crown'd?

**GLOUCESTER**  
Even when you please, since you will have it so.

**BUCKINGHAM**  
Tomorrow, then, we will attend your grace:  
And so most joyfully we take our leave.

**GLOUCESTER**  
Come, let us to our holy task again.  
Farewell, good cousin; farewell, gentle friends.

*Exeunt*

## INTERMISSION

## ACT IV

### SCENE I. Before the Tower.

*Enter, on one side, QUEEN ELIZABETH, DUCHESS OF YORK, and
DORSET; on the other, ANNE, the Duchess of Gloucester*

**DUCHESS OF YORK**  
Daughter, well met.

**LADY ANNE**  
God give your graces both  
A happy and a joyful time of day!

**QUEEN ELIZABETH**  
As much to you, good sister! Whither away?

**LADY ANNE**  
No farther than the Tower; and, as I guess,  
Upon the like devotion as yourselves,  
To gratulate the gentle princes there.

**QUEEN ELIZABETH**  
Kind sister, thanks: we'll enter all together.

*Enter LORD STANLEY*

**LORD STANLEY**  
*\[To LADY ANNE]*  
Come, madam, you must straight to Westminster,  
There to be crowned Richard's royal queen.

**QUEEN ELIZABETH**  
O, cut my lace in sunder, that my pent heart  
May have some scope to beat, or else I swoon  
With this dead-killing news!

**LADY ANNE**  
Despiteful tidings! O unpleasing news!

**DORSET**  
Be of good cheer: mother, how fares your grace?

**QUEEN ELIZABETH**  
O Dorset, speak not to me, get thee hence!  
Death and destruction dog thee at the heels;  
Thy mother's name is ominous to children.  
If thou wilt outstrip death, go cross the seas,  
And live with Richmond, from the reach of hell  
Go, hie thee, hie thee from this slaughter-house,  
Lest thou increase the number of the dead;  
And make me die the thrall of Margaret's curse,  
Nor mother, wife, nor England's counted queen.

**LORD STANLEY**  
Take all the swift advantage of the hours;  
You shall have letters from me to my son  
To meet you on the way, and welcome you.

**DUCHESS OF YORK**  
O ill-dispersing wind of misery!  
O my accursed womb, the bed of death!  
A cockatrice hast thou hatch'd to the world,  
Whose unavoided eye is murderous.

**LORD STANLEY**  
Come, madam, come; I in all haste was sent.

**LADY ANNE**  
And I in all unwillingness will go.  
I would to God that the inclusive verge  
Of golden metal that must round my brow  
Were red-hot steel, to sear me to the brain!  
Anointed let me be with deadly venom,  
And die, ere men can say, God save the queen!

**QUEEN ELIZABETH**  
Go, go, poor soul, I envy not thy glory  
To feed my humour, wish thyself no harm.

**LADY ANNE**  
No! why? When he that is my husband now  
Came to me, as I follow'd Henry's corse;  
O, when, I say, I look'd on Richard's face,  
This was my wish: 'Be thou,' quoth I, 'accursed,  
For making me, so young, so old a widow!  
And, when thou wed'st, let sorrow haunt thy bed;  
And be thy wife--if any be so mad--  
As miserable by the life of thee  
As thou hast made me by my dear lord's death!  
Lo, ere I can repeat this curse again,  
Even in so short a space, my woman's heart  
Grossly grew captive to his honey words  
And proved the subject of my own soul's curse,  
Which ever since hath kept my eyes from rest;  
For never yet one hour in his bed  
Have I enjoy'd the golden dew of sleep,  
But have been waked by his timorous dreams.

**QUEEN ELIZABETH**  
Poor heart, adieu! I pity thy complaining.

**LADY ANNE**  
No more than from my soul I mourn for yours.

**QUEEN ELIZABETH**  
Farewell, thou woful welcomer of glory!

**LADY ANNE**  
Adieu, poor soul, that takest thy leave of it!

**DUCHESS OF YORK**  
*\[To DORSET]*  
Go thou to Richmond, and good fortune guide thee!

*\[To LADY ANNE]*  
Go thou to Richard, and good angels guard thee!

*\[To QUEEN ELIZABETH]*  
Go thou to sanctuary, and good thoughts possess thee!  
I to my grave, where peace and rest lie with me!  
Eighty odd years of sorrow have I seen,  
And each hour's joy wrecked with a week of teen.

**QUEEN ELIZABETH**  
Stay, yet look back with me unto the Tower.  
Pity, you ancient stones, those tender babes  
Whom envy hath immured within your walls!  
Rough cradle for such little pretty ones!  
Rude ragged nurse, old sullen playfellow  
For tender princes, use my babies well!  
So foolish sorrow bids your stones farewell.

*Exeunt*

### SCENE II. London. The palace.

*Sennet. Enter KING RICHARD III, in pomp, crowned;
BUCKINGHAM, CATESBY, and a page*

**KING RICHARD III**  
Stand all apart Cousin of Buckingham!

**BUCKINGHAM**  
My gracious sovereign?

**KING RICHARD III**  
Give me thy hand. /

*Here he ascendeth his throne*

/ Thus high, by thy advice  
And thy assistance, is King Richard seated;  
But shall we wear these honours for a day?  
Or shall they last, and we rejoice in them?

**BUCKINGHAM**  
Still live they and forever may they last!

**KING RICHARD III**  
O Buckingham, now do I play the touch,  
To try if thou be current gold indeed  
Young Edward lives: think now what I would say.

**BUCKINGHAM**  
Say on, my loving lord.

**KING RICHARD III**  
Why, Buckingham, I say, I would be king,

**BUCKINGHAM**  
Why, so you are, my thrice renowned liege.

**KING RICHARD III**  
Ha! am I king? 'tis so: but Edward lives.

**BUCKINGHAM**  
True, noble prince. /

**KING RICHARD III**  
/ O bitter consequence,  
That Edward still should live! 'True, noble prince!'  
Shall I be plain? I wish the bastards dead;  
And I would have it suddenly perform'd.

**BUCKINGHAM**  
Your grace may do your pleasure.

**KING RICHARD III**  
Tut, tut, thou art all ice, thy kindness freezeth:  
Say, have I thy consent that they shall die?

**BUCKINGHAM**  
Give me some breath, some little pause, my lord  
Before I positively herein:  
I will resolve your grace immediately.

*Exit*

**KING RICHARD III**  
I will converse with iron-witted fools  
And unrespective boys: none are for me  
That look into me with considerate eyes:  
High-reaching Buckingham grows circumspect.  
Boy!

**Page**  
My lord?

**KING RICHARD III**  
Know'st thou not any whom corrupting gold  
Would tempt unto a close exploit of death?

**Page**  
My lord, I know a discontented gentleman,  
Whose humble means match not his haughty mind.

**KING RICHARD III**  
What is his name?

**Page**  
His name, my lord, is Tyrrel.

**KING RICHARD III**  
I partly know the man: go, call him hither.

*Exit Page*

The deep-revolving witty Buckingham  
No more shall be the neighbour to my counsel:  
Hath he so long held out with me untired,  
And stops he now for breath?

*Enter STANLEY*

How now! what news with you?

**STANLEY**  
My lord, I hear the Marquis Dorset's fled  
To Richmond, in those parts beyond the sea  
Where he abides. /  
*\[Stands apart]*

**KING RICHARD III**  
/ Catesby! /

**CATESBY**  
/ My lord? /

**KING RICHARD III**  
/ Rumor it abroad  
That Anne, my wife, is sick and like to die:  
I will take order for her keeping close.  
Inquire me out some mean-born gentleman,  
Whom I will marry straight to Clarence' daughter:  
The boy is foolish, and I fear not him.  
Look, how thou dream'st! I say again, give out  
That Anne my wife is sick and like to die:  
About it; for it stands me much upon,  
To stop all hopes whose growth may damage me.

*Exit CATESBY*

I must be married to my brother's daughter,  
Or else my kingdom stands on brittle glass.  
Murder her brothers, and then marry her!  
Uncertain way of gain! But I am in  
So far in blood that sin will pluck on sin:  
Tear-falling pity dwells not in this eye.

*Re-enter Page, with TYRREL*

Is thy name Tyrrel?

**TYRREL**  
James Tyrrel, and your most obedient subject.

**KING RICHARD III**  
Darest thou resolve to kill a friend of mine?

**TYRREL**  
Ay, my lord;  
But I had rather kill two enemies.

**KING RICHARD III**  
Why, there thou hast it: two deep enemies,  
Foes to my rest and my sweet sleep's disturbers  
Are they that I would have thee deal upon:  
Tyrrel, I mean those bastards in the Tower.

**TYRREL**  
Let me have open means to come to them,  
And soon I'll rid you from the fear of them.

**KING RICHARD III**  
Thou sing'st sweet music. Hark, come hither, Tyrrel  
Go, by this token: rise, and lend thine ear:

*\[Whispers]*  
There is no more but so: say it is done,  
And I will love thee, and prefer thee too.

**TYRREL**  
'Tis done, my gracious lord.

**KING RICHARD III**  
Shall we hear from thee, Tyrrel, ere we sleep?

**TYRREL**  
Ye shall, my Lord.

*Exit*

*Re-enter BUCKINGHAM*

**BUCKINGHAM**  
My Lord, I have consider'd in my mind  
The late demand that you did sound me in.

**KING RICHARD III**  
Well, let that pass. Dorset is fled to Richmond.

**BUCKINGHAM**  
My lord, I claim your gift, my due by promise;  
The earldom of Hereford and the moveables  
The which you promised I should possess.

**KING RICHARD III**  
Stanley, look to your wife; if she convey  
Letters to Richmond, you shall answer it.

**BUCKINGHAM**  
What says your highness to my just demand?

**KING RICHARD III**  
As I remember, Henry the Sixth  
Did prophesy that Richmond should be king,  
When Richmond was a little peevish boy.

**BUCKINGHAM**  
My lord, your promise for the earldom,--

**KING RICHARD III**  
Ay, what's o'clock?

**BUCKINGHAM**  
I am thus bold to put your grace in mind  
Of what you promised me.

**KING RICHARD III**  
Well, but what's o'clock?

**BUCKINGHAM**  
Upon the stroke of ten.

**KING RICHARD III**  
Well, let it strike.

**BUCKINGHAM**  
Why let it strike?

**KING RICHARD III**  
Because that, like a Jack, thou keep'st the stroke  
Betwixt thy begging and my meditation.  
I am not in the giving vein today.

**BUCKINGHAM**  
Why, then resolve me whether you will or no.

**KING RICHARD III**  
Thou troublest me; I'm not in the vein.

*Exeunt all but BUCKINGHAM*

**BUCKINGHAM**  
Is it even so? rewards he my true service  
With such deep contempt made I him king for this?  
O, let me think on Hastings, and be gone  
To Brecknock, while my fearful head is on!

*Exit*

### SCENE III. The same.

*Enter KING RICHARD III and TYRREL*

**KING RICHARD III**  
Kind Tyrrel, am I happy in thy news?

**TYRREL**  
If to have done the thing you gave in charge  
Beget your happiness, be happy then,  
For it is done, my lord.

**KING RICHARD III**  
But didst thou see them dead?

**TYRREL**  
I did, my lord.

**KING RICHARD III**  
Come to me, Tyrrel, soon at after supper,  
And thou shalt tell the process of their death.

*Exit TYRREL*

The son of Clarence have I pent up close;  
His daughter meanly have I match'd in marriage;  
The sons of Edward sleep in Abraham's bosom,  
And Anne my wife hath bid the world good night.  
Now, for I know the Breton Richmond aims  
At young Elizabeth, my brother's daughter,  
And, by that knot, looks proudly o'er the crown,  
To her I go, a jolly thriving wooer.

*Enter CATESBY*

**CATESBY**  
My lord!
Buckingham, back'd with the hardy Welshmen,  
Is in the field, and still his power increaseth.

**KING RICHARD III**  
Come, muster men: my counsel is my shield;  
We must be brief when traitors brave the field.

*Exeunt*

### SCENE IV. Before the palace.

*Enter QUEEN MARGARET*

**QUEEN MARGARET**  
So, now prosperity begins to mellow  
And drop into the rotten mouth of death.  
Here in these confines slily have I lurk'd,  
To watch the waning of mine adversaries.  
A dire induction am I witness to,  
And will to France, hoping the consequence  
Will prove as bitter, black, and tragical.  
Withdraw thee, wretched Margaret: who comes here?

*Enter QUEEN ELIZABETH and the DUCHESS OF YORK*

**QUEEN ELIZABETH**  
Ah, my young princes! ah, my tender babes!  
My unblown flowers, new-appearing sweets!  
If yet your gentle souls fly in the air  
And be not fix'd in doom perpetual,  
Hover about me with your airy wings  
And hear your mother's lamentation!

**QUEEN MARGARET**  
Hover about her; say, that right for right  
Hath dimm'd your infant morn to aged night.

**DUCHESS OF YORK**  
So many miseries have crazed my voice,  
That my woe-wearied tongue is mute and dumb,  
Edward Plantagenet, why art thou dead?

**QUEEN MARGARET**  
Plantagenet doth quit Plantagenet.  
Edward for Edward pays a dying debt.

**QUEEN ELIZABETH**  
Wilt thou, O God, fly from such gentle lambs,  
And throw them in the entrails of the wolf?  
When didst thou sleep when such a deed was done?

**QUEEN MARGARET**  
When holy Harry died, and my sweet son.

**DUCHESS OF YORK**  
Blind sight, dead life, poor mortal living ghost,  
Woe's scene, world's shame, grave's due by life usurp'd,  
Brief abstract and record of tedious days,  
Rest thy unrest on England's lawful earth,

*\[Sitting down]*  
Unlawfully made drunk with innocents' blood!

**QUEEN ELIZABETH**  
O, that thou wouldst as well afford a grave  
As thou canst yield a melancholy seat!  
Then would I hide my bones, not rest them here.  
O, who hath any cause to mourn but I?  
*\[Sitting down by her]*

**QUEEN MARGARET**  
If ancient sorrow be most reverend,  
Give mine the benefit of seniory,  
And let my woes frown on the upper hand.  
If sorrow can admit society,

*\[Sitting down with them]*  
Tell o'er your woes again by viewing mine:  
I had an Edward, till a Richard kill'd him;  
I had a Harry, till a Richard kill'd him:  
Thou hadst an Edward, till a Richard kill'd him;  
Thou hadst a Richard, till a Richard killed him;

**DUCHESS OF YORK**  
I had a Richard too, and thou didst kill him;

**QUEEN MARGARET**  
Thou hadst a Clarence too, and Richard kill'd him.  
From forth the kennel of thy womb hath crept  
A hell-hound that doth hunt us all to death:  
O upright, just, and true-disposing God,  
How do I thank thee, that this carnal cur  
Preys on the issue of his mother's body,  
And makes her pew-fellow with others' moan!

**DUCHESS OF YORK**  
O Harry's wife, triumph not in my woes!  
God witness with me, I have wept for thine.

**QUEEN MARGARET**  
Bear with me; I am hungry for revenge,  
And now I cloy me with beholding it.  
Richard yet lives, hell's black intelligencer,  
Only reserved their factor, to buy souls  
And send them thither: but at hand, at hand,  
Ensues his piteous and unpitied end.  
Cancel his bond of life, dear God, I pray,  
That I may live to say, The dog is dead!

**QUEEN ELIZABETH**  
O, thou didst prophesy the time would come  
That I should wish for thee to help me curse  
That bottled spider, that foul bunch-back'd toad!

**QUEEN MARGARET**  
I call'd thee then vain flourish of my fortune;  
I call'd thee then poor shadow, painted queen;  
Thou didst usurp my place, and dost thou not  
Usurp the just proportion of my sorrow?  
Now thy proud neck bears half my burthen'd yoke;  
From which even here I slip my weary neck,  
And leave the burthen of it all on thee.  
Farewell, York's wife, and queen of sad mischance:  
These English woes will make me smile in France.

**QUEEN ELIZABETH**  
O thou well skill'd in curses, stay awhile,  
And teach me how to curse mine enemies!

**QUEEN MARGARET**  
Forbear to sleep the nights, and fast the days;  
Compare dead happiness with living woe;  
Think that thy babes were fairer than they were,  
And he that slew them fouler than he is:  
Bettering thy loss makes the bad causer worse:  
Revolving this will teach thee how to curse.

**QUEEN ELIZABETH**  
My words are dull; O, quicken them with thine!

**QUEEN MARGARET**  
Thy woes will make them sharp, and pierce like mine.

*Exit*

**DUCHESS OF YORK**  
Why should calamity be full of words?

**QUEEN ELIZABETH**  
Windy attorneys to their client woes,  
Airy succeeders of intestate joys,  
Poor breathing orators of miseries!  
Let them have scope: though what they do impart  
Help not all, yet do they ease the heart.

**DUCHESS OF YORK**  
If so, then be not tongue-tied: go with me.  
And in the breath of bitter words let's smother  
My damned son, which thy two sweet sons smother'd.  
I hear his drum: be copious in exclaims.

*Enter KING RICHARD III, marching, with drums and trumpets*

**KING RICHARD III**  
Who intercepts my expedition?

**DUCHESS OF YORK**  
O, she that might have intercepted thee,  
By strangling thee in her accursed womb  
From all the slaughters, wretch, that thou hast done!

**QUEEN ELIZABETH**  
Hidest thou that forehead with a golden crown,  
Where should be graven, if that right were right,  
The slaughter of the prince that owed that crown,  
And the dire death of my two sons and brothers?  
Tell me, thou villain slave, where are my children?

**DUCHESS OF YORK**  
Thou toad, thou toad, where is thy brother Clarence?  
And little Ned Plantagenet, his son?

**KING RICHARD III**  
Let not the heavens hear these tell-tale women  
Rail on the Lord's enointed: strike, I say!
Either be patient, and entreat me fair,  
Or with the clamorous report of war  
Thus will I drown your exclamations.

**DUCHESS OF YORK**  
Art thou my son?

**KING RICHARD III**  
Ay, I thank God, my father, and yourself.

**DUCHESS OF YORK**  
Then patiently hear my impatience.
I will be mild and gentle in my speech.

**KING RICHARD III**  
And brief, good mother; for I am in haste.

**DUCHESS OF YORK**  
Art thou so hasty? I have stay'd for thee,  
God knows, in anguish, pain and agony.

**KING RICHARD III**  
And came I not at last to comfort you?

**DUCHESS OF YORK**  
No, by the holy rood, thou know'st it well,  
Thou camest on earth to make the earth my hell.

**KING RICHARD III**  
You speak too bitterly.

**DUCHESS OF YORK**  
Hear me a word;  
For I shall never speak to thee again.

**KING RICHARD III**  
So.

**DUCHESS OF YORK**  
Either thou wilt die, by God's just ordinance,  
Ere from this war thou turn a conqueror,  
Or I with grief and extreme age shall perish  
And never look upon thy face again.  
Therefore take with thee my most heavy curse;  
Which, in the day of battle, tire thee more  
Than all the complete armor that thou wear'st!  
My prayers on the adverse party fight;  
And there the little souls of Edward's children  
Whisper the spirits of thine enemies  
And promise them success and victory.  
Bloody thou art, bloody will be thy end;  
Shame serves thy life and doth thy death attend.

*Exit*

**QUEEN ELIZABETH**  
Though far more cause, yet much less spirit to curse  
Abides in me; I say amen to all.

**KING RICHARD III**  
Stay, madam; I must speak a word with you.

**QUEEN ELIZABETH**  
I have no more sons of the royal blood  
For thee to murder: for my daughters, Richard,  
They shall be praying nuns, not weeping queens;  
And therefore level not to hit their lives.

**KING RICHARD III**  
You have a daughter call'd Elizabeth,  
Virtuous and fair, royal and gracious.

**QUEEN ELIZABETH**  
And must she die for this? O, let her live,  
And I'll corrupt her manners, stain her beauty;  
Slander myself as false to Edward's bed;  
Throw over her the veil of infamy:  
So she may live unscarr'd of bleeding slaughter,  
I will confess she was not Edward's daughter.

**KING RICHARD III**  
Wrong not her birth, she is of royal blood.

**QUEEN ELIZABETH**  
To save her life, I'll say she is not so.

**KING RICHARD III**  
Her life is only safest in her birth.

**QUEEN ELIZABETH**  
Flatter my sorrows with report of it;  
Tell me what state, what dignity, what honor,  
Canst thou demise to any child of mine?
Be brief, lest that be process of thy kindness  
Last longer telling than thy kindness' date.

**KING RICHARD III**  
Then know, that from my soul I love thy daughter.

**QUEEN ELIZABETH**  
My daughter's mother thinks it with her soul.

**KING RICHARD III**  
What do you think?

**QUEEN ELIZABETH**  
That thou dost love my daughter from thy soul:  
So from thy soul's love didst thou love her brothers;  
And from my heart's love I do thank thee for it.

**KING RICHARD III**  
Be not so hasty to confound my meaning:  
I mean, that with my soul I love thy daughter,  
And mean to make her queen of England.

**QUEEN ELIZABETH**  
Say then, who dost thou mean shall be her king?

**KING RICHARD III**  
Even he that makes her queen who should be else?

**QUEEN ELIZABETH**  
What, thou?

**KING RICHARD III**  
I, even I: what think you of it, madam?

**QUEEN ELIZABETH**  
How canst thou woo her?

**KING RICHARD III**  
That would I learn of you,  
As one that are best acquainted with her humor.

**QUEEN ELIZABETH**  
And wilt thou learn of me?

**KING RICHARD III**  
Madam, with all my heart.

**QUEEN ELIZABETH**  
Send to her, by the man that slew her brothers,  
A pair of bleeding-hearts; thereon engrave  
Edward and York; then haply she will weep.

**KING RICHARD III**  
Come, come, you mock me; this is not the way  
To win our daughter. /

**QUEEN ELIZABETH**  
/ There is no other way  
Unless thou couldst put on some other shape.

**KING RICHARD III**  
Say that I did all this for love of her.

**QUEEN ELIZABETH**  
Nay, then indeed she cannot choose but hate thee,  
Having bought love with such a bloody spoil.

**KING RICHARD III**  
Look, what is done cannot be now amended:  
Men shall deal unadvisedly sometimes,  
Which after hours give leisure to repent.  
If I did take the kingdom from your sons,  
To make amends, Ill give it to your daughter.  
The loss you have is but a son being king,  
And by that loss your daughter is made queen.

**QUEEN ELIZABETH**  
What were I best to say? her father's brother  
Would be her lord? or shall I say, her uncle?  
Or, he that slew her brothers and her uncles?  
Under what title shall I woo for thee,  
That God, the law, my honor and her love,  
Can make seem pleasing to her tender years?

**KING RICHARD III**  
Infer fair England's peace by this alliance.

**QUEEN ELIZABETH**  
Which she shall purchase with still lasting war.

**KING RICHARD III**  
Say, I will love her everlastingly.

**QUEEN ELIZABETH**  
But how long shall that title 'ever' last?

**KING RICHARD III**  
Your reasons are too shallow and too quick.

**QUEEN ELIZABETH**  
O no, my reasons are too deep and dead;  
Too deep and dead, poor infants, in their grave.

**KING RICHARD III**  
I swear--

**QUEEN ELIZABETH**  
Swear then by something that thou hast not wrong'd.

**KING RICHARD III**  
Now, by the world-- /

**QUEEN ELIZABETH**  
/ 'Tis full of thy foul wrongs.

**KING RICHARD III**  
Then, by myself-- /

**QUEEN ELIZABETH**  
/ Thyself thyself misusest.

**KING RICHARD III**  
Why then, by God-- /

**QUEEN ELIZABETH**  
/ God's wrong is most of all.  
If thou hadst fear'd to break an oath by Him,  
The unity the king thy brother made  
Had not been broken, nor my brother slain:  
If thou hadst fear'd to break an oath by Him,  
The imperial metal, circling now thy brow,  
Had graced the tender temples of my child,  
And both the princes had been breathing here,  
Which now, two tender playfellows to dust,  
Thy broken faith hath made a prey for worms.  
What canst thou swear by now? /

**KING RICHARD III**  
/ The time to come.

**QUEEN ELIZABETH**  
That thou hast wronged in the time o'erpast;  
For I myself have many tears to wash  
Hereafter time, for time past wrong'd by thee.  
The children live, whose parents thou hast slaughter'd,  
Ungovern'd youth, to wail it in their age;  
The parents live, whose children thou hast butcher'd,  
Old wither'd plants, to wail it with their age.  
Swear not by time to come; for that thou hast  
Misused ere used, by time misused o'erpast.

**KING RICHARD III**  
Day, yield me not thy light; nor, night, thy rest!  
Be opposite all planets of good luck  
To my proceedings, if, with pure heart's love,  
Immaculate devotion, holy thoughts,  
I tender not thy beauteous princely daughter!  
In her consists my happiness and thine;  
Without her, follows to this land and me,  
To thee, herself, and many a Christian soul,  
Death, desolation, ruin and decay:  
It cannot be avoided but by this;  
It will not be avoided but by this.

**QUEEN ELIZABETH**  
Shall I be tempted of the devil thus?
Shall I forget myself to be myself?

**KING RICHARD III**  
Ay, if yourself's remembrance wrong yourself.

**QUEEN ELIZABETH**  
But thou didst kill my children.

**KING RICHARD III**  
But in your daughter's womb I bury them:  
Where in that nest of spicery they shall breed  
Selves of themselves, to your recomforture.

**QUEEN ELIZABETH**  
Shall I go win my daughter to thy will?

**KING RICHARD III**  
And be a happy mother by the deed.

**QUEEN ELIZABETH**  
I go. Write to me very shortly.  
And you shall understand from me her mind.

**KING RICHARD III**  
Bear her my true love's kiss; and so, farewell.

*Exit QUEEN ELIZABETH*

Relenting fool, and shallow, changing woman!

*Enter RATCLIFF; CATESBY following*

How now! what news?

**RATCLIFF**  
My gracious sovereign, on the western coast  
Rideth a puissant navy; to the shore  
Throng many doubtful hollow-hearted friends,  
Unarm'd, and unresolved to beat them back:  
'Tis thought that Richmond is their admiral;  
And there they hull, expecting but the aid  
Of Buckingham to welcome them ashore.

**KING RICHARD III**  
Some light-foot friend post to the Duke of Norfolk:  
Ratcliff, thyself, or Catesby; where is he?

**CATESBY**  
Here, my lord. /

**KING RICHARD III**  
/ Fly to the duke:

*\[To RATCLIFF]*  
/ Post thou to Sal'sb'ry  
When thou comest thither-- /

*\[To CATESBY]*  
/ Dull, unmindful villain,  
Why stand'st thou still, and go'st not to the duke?

**CATESBY**  
First, mighty sovereign, let me know your mind,  
What from your grace I shall deliver to him.

**KING RICHARD III**  
O, true, good Catesby: bid him levy straight  
The greatest strength and power he can make,  
And meet me presently at Salisbury.

**CATESBY**  
I go.

*Exit*

**RATCLIFF**  
What is't your highness' pleasure I shall do at Salisbury?

**KING RICHARD III**  
Why, what wouldst thou do there before I go?

**RATCLIFF**  
Your highness told me I should post before.

**KING RICHARD III**  
My mind is changed, sir, my mind is changed.

*Enter STANLEY*

How now, what news with you?

**STANLEY**  
None good, my lord, to please you with the hearing;  
Nor none so bad, but it may well be told.

**KING RICHARD III**  
Hoyday, a riddle! neither good nor bad!  
Why dost thou run so many mile about,  
When thou mayst tell thy tale a nearer way?

**STANLEY**  
Richmond is on the seas.

**KING RICHARD III**  
There let him sink, and be the seas on him!  
White-liver'd runagate, what doth he there?

**STANLEY**  
I know not, mighty sovereign, but by guess.  
Stirr'd up by Dorset and by Buckingham,  
He makes for England, there to claim the crown.

**KING RICHARD III**  
Is the chair empty? is the sword unsway'd?  
Is the king dead? the empire unpossess'd?  
And who is England's king but great York's heir?  
Then, tell me, what doth he upon the sea?

**STANLEY**  
Unless for that, my liege, I cannot guess.

**KING RICHARD III**  
Unless for that he comes to be your liege,  
Thou wilt revolt, and fly to him, I fear.

**STANLEY**  
No, mighty liege; therefore mistrust me not.

**KING RICHARD III**  
Where is thy power, then, to beat him back?  
Where are thy tenants and thy followers?  
Are they not now upon the western shore.

**STANLEY**  
No, my good lord, my friends are in the north.

**KING RICHARD III**  
Cold friends to Richard: what do they in the north,  
When they should serve their sovereign in the west?

**STANLEY**  
They have not been commanded, mighty sovereign:  
Please it your majesty to give me leave,  
I'll muster up my friends, and meet your grace  
Where and what time your majesty shall please.

**KING RICHARD III**  
Ay, ay. thou wouldst be gone to join with Richmond:  
I will not trust you, sir.

**STANLEY**  
Most mighty sovereign,  
You have no cause to hold my friendship doubtful:  
I never was nor never will be false.

**KING RICHARD III**  
Well,  
Go muster men; but, hear you, leave behind  
Your son, George Stanley: look your faith be firm.  
Or else his head's assurance is but frail.

*Exit*

*Enter a Messenger*

**Second Messenger**  
My lord, the army of the Duke of Buckingham--

**KING RICHARD III**  
Out on you, owls! nothing but songs of death?  
*\[He striketh him]*

**Second Messenger**  
The news I have to tell your majesty  
Is, that by sudden floods and fall of waters,  
Buckingham's army is dispersed and scatter'd;  
And he himself wander'd away alone,  
No man knows whither. /

**KING RICHARD III**  
/ I cry thee mercy:  
There is my purse to cure that blow of thine.  
Hath any well-advised friend proclaim'd  
Reward to him that brings the traitor in?

**Second Messenger**  
Such proclamation hath been made, my liege.

*Re-enter CATESBY*

**CATESBY**  
My liege, the Duke of Buckingham is taken;  
That is the best news: that the Earl of Richmond  
Is with a mighty power landed at Milford,  
Is colder tidings, yet they must be told.

**KING RICHARD III**  
Away towards Salisbury! while we reason here,  
A royal battle might be won and lost  
Some one take order Buckingham be brought  
To Salisbury; the rest march on with me.

*Flourish. Exeunt*

## ACT V

### SCENE I. Salisbury. An open place.

*Enter the Sheriff, and BUCKINGHAM, led to execution*

**BUCKINGHAM**  
Will not King Richard let me speak with him?

**Sheriff**  
No, my good lord; therefore be patient.

**BUCKINGHAM**  
Now Margaret's curse is fallen upon my head;  
'When he,' quoth she, 'shall split thy heart with sorrow,  
Remember Margaret was a prophetess.'  
Come, sirs, convey me to the block of shame;  
Wrong hath but wrong, and blame the due of blame.

*Exeunt*

### SCENE II. The camp near Tamworth.

*Enter RICHMOND, OXFORD, and BLUNT*

**RICHMOND**  
Fellows in arms, and my most loving friends,  
Thus far into the bowels of the land  
Have we march'd on without impediment;  
And here receive we from our father Stanley  
Lines of fair comfort and encouragement.  
The wretched, bloody, and usurping boar,  
Lies now even in the center of this isle.  
In God's name, cheerly on, courageous friends,  
To reap the harvest of perpetual peace  
By this one bloody trial of sharp war.

**OXFORD**  
Every man's conscience is a thousand swords,  
To fight against that bloody homicide.  
I doubt not but his friends will fly to us.

**BLUNT**  
He hath no friends but who are friends for fear.  
Which in his greatest need will shrink from him.

**RICHMOND**  
All for our vantage. Then, in God's name, march:  
True hope is swift, and flies with swallow's wings:  
Kings it makes gods, and meaner creatures kings.

*Exeunt*

### SCENE III. Bosworth Field.

*Enter KING RICHARD III in arms, with CATESBY*

**KING RICHARD III**  
Here pitch our tents, even here in Bosworth field.  
Up with my tent there! here will I lie tonight;  
But where tomorrow? Well, all's one for that.  
Who hath descried the number of the foe?

**CATESBY**  
Six or seven thousand is their utmost power.

**KING RICHARD III**  
Why, our battalion trebles that account:  
Let us survey the vantage of the field  
Call for some men of sound direction  
Let's want no discipline, make no delay,  
For, lords, tomorrow is a busy day.

*Exeunt*

*Enter, on the other side of the field, RICHMOND, BLUNT,
and OXFORD.*

**RICHMOND**  
The weary sun hath made a golden set,  
And by the bright track of his fiery car,  
Gives signal, of a goodly day tomorrow.  
Give me some ink and paper in my tent  
I'll draw the form and model of our battle,  
Limit each leader to his several charge,  
And part in just proportion our small strength.  
The Earl of Pembroke keeps his regiment:  
Good Captain Blunt, bear my good night to him  
And by the second hour in the morning  
Desire the earl to see me in my tent:  
Yet one thing more, good Blunt, before thou go'st,  
Where is Lord Stanley quarter'd, dost thou know?

**BLUNT**  
Unless I have mista'en his colors much,  
Which well I am assured I have not done,  
His regiment lies half a mile at least  
South from the mighty power of the king.

**RICHMOND**  
If without peril it be possible,  
Good Captain Blunt, bear my good-night to him,  
And give him from me this most needful scroll.

**BLUNT**  
Upon my life, my lord, I'll under-take it;  
And so, God give you quiet rest tonight!

**RICHMOND**  
Good night, good Captain Blunt. Come gentlemen,  
Let us consult upon tomorrow's business  
In to our tent; the air is raw and cold.

*They withdraw into the tent*

*Enter, to his tent, KING RICHARD III, RATCLIFF, and
CATESBY*

**KING RICHARD III**  
What is't o'clock? /

**CATESBY**  
/ It's supper-time, my lord;  
It's nine o'clock. /

**KING RICHARD III**  
/ I will not sup tonight.  
Give me some ink and paper.  
What, is my beaver easier than it was?  
And all my armour laid into my tent?

**CATESBY**  
It is, my liege; and all things are in readiness.

**KING RICHARD III**  
Send out a pursuivant at arms  
To Stanley's regiment; bid him bring his power  
Before sunrising, lest his son George fall  
Into the blind cave of eternal night.

*Exit CATESBY*

Ratcliff! /

**RATCLIFF**  
/ My lord? /

**KING RICHARD III**  
/ Give me a bowl of wine:  
I have not that alacrity of spirit,  
Nor cheer of mind, that I was wont to have.  
Set it down. Is ink and paper ready?

**RATCLIFF**  
It is, my lord.

**KING RICHARD III**  
Bid my guard watch; leave me.  
Ratcliff, about the mid of night come to my tent  
And help to arm me. Leave me, I say.

*Exeunt RATCLIFF*

*Enter STANLEY to RICHMOND in his tent, Lords and others
attending*

**STANLEY**  
Fortune and victory sit on thy helm!

**RICHMOND**  
All comfort that the dark night can afford  
Be to thy person, noble father-in-law!  
Tell me, how fares our loving mother?

**STANLEY**  
I, by attorney, bless thee from thy mother  
Who prays continually for Richmond's good:  
In brief,--for so the season bids us be,--  
Prepare thy battle early in the morning,  
And put thy fortune to the arbitrement  
Of bloody strokes and mortal-staring war.  
I, as I may--that which I would I cannot,--  
With best advantage will deceive the time,  
And aid thee in this doubtful shock of arms:  
But on thy side I may not be too forward  
Lest, being seen, thy brother, tender George,  
Be executed in his father's sight.  
Farewell: the leisure and the fearful time  
Cuts off the ceremonious vows of love  
And ample interchange of sweet discourse.  
Once more, adieu: be valiant, and speed well!

**RICHMOND**  
Good lords, conduct him to his regiment:  
I'll strive, with troubled thoughts, to take a nap,  
Lest leaden slumber peise me down tomorrow,  
When I should mount with wings of victory:  
Once more, good night, kind lords and gentlemen.

*Exeunt all but RICHMOND*

O Thou, whose captain I account myself,  
Look on my forces with a gracious eye;  
Put in their hands thy bruising irons of wrath,  
That they may crush down with a heavy fall  
The usurping helmets of our adversaries!  
Make us thy ministers of chastisement,  
That we may praise thee in the victory!  
To thee I do commend my watchful soul,  
Ere I let fall the windows of mine eyes:  
Sleeping and waking, O, defend me still!

*Sleeps*

*Enter the Ghost of CLARENCE*

**Ghost of CLARENCE**  
*\[To KING RICHARD III]*  
Let me sit heavy on thy soul tomorrow!  
I, that was wash'd to death with fulsome wine,  
Poor Clarence, by thy guile betrayed to death!  
Tomorrow in the battle think on me,  
And fall thy edgeless sword: despair, and die!--

*\[To RICHMOND]*  
Thou offspring of the house of Lancaster  
The wronged heirs of York do pray for thee  
Good angels guard thy battle! live, and flourish!

*Enter the Ghost of RIVERS*

**Ghost of RIVERS**  
*\[To KING RICHARD III]*  
Let me sit heavy on thy soul tomorrow.  
Rivers, that died at Pomfret! despair, and die!

*\[To RICHMOND]*  
Awake, and think my wrongs in Richard's bosom  
Will conquer him! awake, and win the day!

*Enter the Ghost of HASTINGS*

**Ghost of HASTINGS**  
*\[To KING RICHARD III]*  
Bloody and guilty, guiltily awake,  
And in a bloody battle end thy days!  
Think on Lord Hastings: despair, and die!

*\[To RICHMOND]*  
Quiet untroubled soul, awake, awake!  
Arm, fight, and conquer, for fair England's sake!

*Enter the Ghost of LADY ANNE*

**Ghost of LADY ANNE**  
*\[To KING RICHARD III]*  
Richard, thy wife, that wretched Anne thy wife,  
That never slept a quiet hour with thee,  
Now fills thy sleep with perturbations.  
Tomorrow in the battle think on me,  
And fall thy edgeless sword: despair, and die!

*\[To RICHMOND]*  
Thou quiet soul, sleep thou a quiet sleep  
Dream of success and happy victory!  
Thy adversary's wife doth pray for thee.

*Enter the Ghost of BUCKINGHAM*

**Ghost of BUCKINGHAM**  
*\[To KING RICHARD III]*  
The last was I that helped thee to the crown;  
The last was I that felt thy tyranny:  
O, in the battle think on Buckingham,  
And die in terror of thy guiltiness!  
Dream on, dream on, of bloody deeds and death:  
Fainting, despair; despairing, yield thy breath!

*\[To RICHMOND]*  
I died for hope ere I could lend thee aid:  
But cheer thy heart, and be thou not dismay'd:  
God and good angel fight on Richmond's side;  
And Richard falls in height of all his pride.

*The Ghosts vanish*

*KING RICHARD III starts out of his dream*

**KING RICHARD III**  
Give me another horse: bind up my wounds.  
O coward conscience, how dost thou afflict me!  
The lights burn blue. It is now dead midnight.  
Methought the souls of all that I had murder'd  
Came to my tent; and every one did threat  
Tomorrow's vengeance on the head of Richard.

*Enter RATCLIFF*

**RATCLIFF**  
My lord!

**KING RICHARD III**  
'Zounds! who is there?

**RATCLIFF**  
Ratcliff, my lord; 'tis I. The early village-cock  
Hath twice done salutation to the morn;  
Your friends are up, and buckle on their armor.

**KING RICHARD III**  
O Ratcliff, I have dream'd a fearful dream!  
What thinkest thou, will our friends prove all true?

**RATCLIFF**  
No doubt, my lord.

**KING RICHARD III**  
O Ratcliff, I fear, I fear,--

**RATCLIFF**  
Nay, good my lord, be not afraid of shadows.

**KING RICHARD III**  
By the apostle Paul, shadows tonight  
Have struck more terror to the soul of Richard  
Than can the substance of ten thousand soldiers  
Armed in proof, and led by shallow Richmond.  
It is not yet near day. Come, go with me;  
Under our tents I'll play the eaves-dropper,  
To see if any mean to shrink from me.

*Exeunt*

*Enter BLUNT to RICHMOND, sitting in his tent*

**BLUNT**  
Good morrow, Richmond!

**RICHMOND**  
Cry mercy, lord and watchful gentle sir,  
That you have ta'en a tardy sluggard here.

**BLUNT**  
How have you slept, my lord?

**RICHMOND**  
The sweetest sleep, and fairest-boding dreams  
That ever enter'd in a drowsy head,  
Have I since your departure had, my lord.  
How far into the morning is it, sir?

**BLUNT**  
Upon the stroke of four.

**RICHMOND**  
Why, then 'tis time to arm and give direction.

*\[His oration to his soldiers]*  
More than I have said, loving countrymen,  
The leisure and enforcement of the time  
Forbids to dwell upon: yet remember this,  
God and our good cause fight upon our side;  
The prayers of holy saints and wronged souls,  
Like high-rear'd bulwarks, stand before our faces;  
Richard except, those whom we fight against  
Had rather have us win than him they follow:  
For what is he they follow? truly, gentlemen,  
A bloody tyrant and a homicide;  
One raised in blood, and one in blood establish'd;  
One that made means to come by what he hath,  
And slaughter'd those that were the means to help him;  
If you do fight against your country's foes,  
Your country's fat shall pay your pains the hire;  
If you do fight in safeguard of your wives,  
Your wives shall welcome home the conquerors;  
If you do free your children from the sword,  
Your children's children quit it in your age.  
Then, in the name of God and all these rights,  
Advance your standards, draw your willing swords.  
Sound drums and trumpets boldly and cheerfully;  
God and Saint George! Richmond and victory!

*Exeunt*

*Re-enter KING RICHARD, and RATCLIFF*

**KING RICHARD III**  
What said Northumberland as touching Richmond?

**RATCLIFF**  
That he was never trained up in arms.

**KING RICHARD III**  
He said the truth: and what said Surrey then?

**RATCLIFF**  
He smiled and said 'The better for our purpose.'

**KING RICHARD III**  
He was in the right; and so indeed it is.

*Clock striketh*

Ten the clock there. Give me a calendar.  
Who saw the sun today? /

**RATCLIFF**  
/ Not I, my lord.

**KING RICHARD III**  
Then he disdains to shine; for by the book  
He should have braved the east an hour ago  
A black day will it be to somebody. Ratcliff!

**RATCLIFF**  
My lord? /

**KING RICHARD III**  
/ The sun will not be seen today;  
The sky doth frown and lour upon our army.  
I would these dewy tears were from the ground.  
Not shine today! Why, what is that to me  
More than to Richmond? for the selfsame heaven  
That frowns on me looks sadly upon him.

*Enter CATESBY*

**CATESBY**  
Arm, arm, my lord; the foe vaunts in the field.

**KING RICHARD III**  
Come, bustle, bustle; caparison my horse.  
Call up Lord Stanley, bid him bring his power:  
I will lead forth my soldiers to the plain.

*\[His oration to his Army]*  
What shall I say more than I have inferr'd?  
Remember whom you are to cope withal;  
A sort of vagabonds, rascals, and runaways,  
A scum of Bretons, and base lackey peasants,  
Whom their o'er-cloyed country vomits forth  
To desperate ventures and assured destruction.  
You sleeping safe, they bring to you unrest;  
You having lands, and blest with beauteous wives,  
They would restrain the one, distain the other.  
If we be conquer'd, let men conquer us,  
And not these bastard Bretons; whom our fathers  
Have in their own land beaten, bobb'd, and thump'd,  
And in record, left them the heirs of shame.  
Shall these enjoy our lands? lie with our wives?  
Ravish our daughters? /

*Drum afar off*

/ Hark! I hear their drum.  
Advance our standards, set upon our foes  
Inspire us with the spleen of fiery dragons!  
Upon them! victory sits on our helms.

*Exeunt*

### SCENE IV. Another part of the field.

*Alarum: excursions. Enter RATCLIFF and CATESBY*

**CATESBY**  
The king enacts more wonders than a man,  
Daring an opposite to every danger:  
His horse is slain, and all on foot he fights,  
Seeking for Richmond in the throat of death.

*Alarums. Enter KING RICHARD III*

**KING RICHARD III**  
A horse! a horse! my kingdom for a horse!

**CATESBY**  
Withdraw, my lord; I'll help you to a horse.

**KING RICHARD III**  
Slave, I have set my life upon a cast,  
And I will stand the hazard of the die:  
I think there be six Richmonds in the field;  
Five have I slain today instead of him.  
A horse! a horse! my kingdom for a horse!

*Exeunt*

### SCENE V. Another part of the field.

*Alarum. Enter KING RICHARD III and RICHMOND; they fight.
KING RICHARD III is slain.*

*Retreat and flourish.*

*Re-enter RICHMOND, STANLEY bearing the crown, with
OXFORD, and BLUNT*

**RICHMOND**  
God and your arms be praised, victorious friends,  
The day is ours, the bloody dog is dead.

**DERBY**  
Courageous Richmond, well hast thou acquit thee.  
Lo, here, this long-usurped royalty  
From the dead temples of this bloody wretch  
Have I pluck'd off, to grace thy brows withal:  
Wear it, enjoy it, and make much of it.

**RICHMOND**  
Great God of heaven, say Amen to all!  
But, tell me, is young George Stanley living?

**DERBY**  
He is, my lord, and safe in Leicester town;  
Whither, if it please you, we may now withdraw us.

**RICHMOND**  
Proclaim a pardon to the soldiers fled  
That in submission will return to us:  
And then, as we have ta'en the sacrament,  
We will unite the white rose and the red:  
England hath long been mad, and scarr'd herself;  
The brother blindly shed the brother's blood,  
The father rashly slaughter'd his own son,  
The son, compell'd, been butcher to the sire:  
All this divided York and Lancaster,  
Divided in their dire division,  
O, now, let Richmond and Elizabeth,  
The true succeeders of each royal house,  
By God's fair ordinance conjoin together!  
And let their heirs, God, if thy will be so,  
Enrich the time to come with smooth-faced peace,  
With smiling plenty and fair prosperous days!  
Let them not live to taste this land's increase  
That would with treason wound this fair land's peace!  
Now civil wounds are stopp'd, peace lives again:  
That she may long live here, God say amen!

*Exeunt*

## ACT I

### PROLOGUE

*Enter Chorus*

**Chorus**  
O for a Muse of fire, that would ascend  
The brightest heaven of invention,  
A kingdom for a stage, princes to act  
And monarchs to behold the swelling scene!  
Then should the warlike Harry, like himself,  
Assume the port of Mars; and at his heels,  
Leash'd in like hounds, should famine, sword and fire  
Crouch for employment. But pardon, and gentles all,  
The flat unraised spirits that have dared  
On this unworthy scaffold to bring forth  
So great an object: can this cockpit hold  
The vasty fields of France? or may we cram  
Within this wooden O the very casques  
That did affright the air at Agincourt?  
O, pardon! since a crooked figure may  
Attest in little place a million;  
And let us, ciphers to this great accompt,  
On your imaginary forces work.  
Suppose within the girdle of these walls  
Are now confined two mighty monarchies,  
Whose high upreared and abutting fronts  
The perilous narrow ocean parts asunder:  
Piece out our imperfections with your thoughts;  
Into a thousand parts divide on man,  
And make imaginary puissance;  
Think when we talk of horses, that you see them  
Printing their proud hoofs i' the receiving earth;  
For 'tis your thoughts that now must deck our kings,  
Carry them here and there; jumping o'er times,  
Turning the accomplishment of many years  
Into an hour-glass: for the which supply,  
Admit me Chorus to this history;  
Who prologue-like your humble patience pray,  
Gently to hear, kindly to judge, our play.

*Exit*

### SCENE II. The same. The Presence chamber.

*Enter KING HENRY V and EXETER*

**KING HENRY V**  
Where is my gracious Lord of Canterbury?

**EXETER**  
Not here in presence.

**KING HENRY V**  
Send for him, good uncle.

**WESTMORELAND**  
Shall we call in the ambassador, my liege?

**KING HENRY V**  
Not yet, my cousin: we would be resolved,  
Before we hear him, of some things of weight  
That task our thoughts, concerning us and France.

*Enter the ARCHBISHOP OF CANTERBURY*

**CANTERBURY**  
God and his angels guard your sacred throne  
And make you long become it! /

**KING HENRY V**  
/ Sure, we thank you.  
My learned lord, we pray you to proceed  
And justly and religiously unfold  
Why the law Salique that they have in France  
Or should, or should not, bar us in our claim:  
And God forbid, my dear and faithful lord,  
That you should fashion, wrest, or bow your reading,  
Or nicely charge your understanding soul  
With opening titles miscreate, whose right  
Suits not in native colours with the truth;  
For God doth know how many now in health  
Shall drop their blood in approbation  
Of what your reverence shall incite us to.  
Under this conjuration, speak, my lord;  
For we will hear, note and believe in heart  
That what you speak is in your conscience wash'd  
As pure as sin with baptism.

**CANTERBURY**  
Then hear me, gracious sovereign, and you peers,  
That owe yourselves, your lives and services  
To this imperial throne. There is no bar  
To make against your highness' claim to France  
But this, which they produce from Pharamond,  
'In terram Salicam mulieres ne succedant:'  
'No woman shall succeed in Salique land:'  
Which Salique land the French unjustly gloze  
To be the realm of France, and Pharamond  
The founder of this law and female bar.  
Yet their own authors faithfully affirm  
That the land Salique is in Germany,  
Between the floods of Sala and of Elbe;  
Where Charles the Great, having subdued the Saxons,  
There left behind and settled certain French;  
Who, holding in disdain the German women  
For some dishonest manners of their life,  
Establish'd then this law; to wit, no female  
Should be inheritrix in Salique land:  
And thus they would hold up this Salique law  
To bar your highness claiming from the female.

**KING HENRY V**  
May I with right and conscience make this claim?

**CANTERBURY**  
The sin upon my head, dread sovereign!  
For in the book of Numbers is it writ,  
When the man dies, let the inheritance  
Descend unto the daughter. Gracious lord,  
Stand for your own; unwind your bloody flag;  
Look back into your mighty ancestors:  
Go, my dread lord, to your great-grandsire's tomb,  
From whom you claim; invoke his warlike spirit,  
And your great-uncle's, Edward the Black Prince,  
Who on the French ground play'd a tragedy,  
Making defeat on the full power of France,  
Whiles his most mighty father on a hill  
Stood smiling to behold his lion's whelp  
Forage in blood of French nobility.  
O noble English, that could entertain  
With half their forces the full Pride of France  
And let another half stand laughing by,  
All out of work and cold for action!

**EXETER**  
Your brother kings and monarchs of the earth  
Do all expect that you should rouse yourself,  
As did the former lions of your blood.

**KING HENRY V**  
Call in the messengers sent from the Dauphin.

*Exit EXETER*

Now are we well resolved; and, by God's help,  
France being ours, we'll bend it to our awe,  
Or break it all to pieces: or there we'll sit,  
Ruling in large and ample empery  
O'er France and all her almost kingly dukedoms,  
Either our history shall with full mouth  
Speak freely of our acts, or else our grave,  
Like Turkish mute, shall have a tongueless mouth,  
Not worshipp'd with a waxen epitaph.

*Re-Enter EXETER with the Ambassador of France*

Now are we well prepared to know the pleasure  
Of our fair cousin Dauphin; for we hear  
Your greeting is from him, not from the king.

**Ambassador**  
May't please your majesty to give us leave  
Freely to render what we have in charge;  
Or shall we sparingly show you far off  
The Dauphin's meaning and our embassy?

**KING HENRY V**  
We are no tyrant, but a Christian king;  
Unto whose grace our passion is as subject  
As are our wretches fetter'd in our prisons:  
Therefore with frank and with uncurbed plainness  
Tell us the Dauphin's mind.

**Ambassador**  
Your highness, lately sending into France,  
Did claim some certain dukedoms, in the right  
Of your great predecessor, King Edward the Third.  
In answer of which claim, the prince our master  
Says that you savour too much of your youth,  
And bids you be advised there's nought in France  
That can be with a nimble galliard won;  
You cannot revel into dukedoms there.  
He therefore sends you, meeter for your spirit,  
This tun of treasure; and, in lieu of this,  
Desires you let the dukedoms that you claim  
Hear no more of you. This the Dauphin speaks.

**KING HENRY V**  
What treasure, uncle?

**EXETER**  
Tennis-balls, my liege.

**KING HENRY V**  
We are glad the Dauphin is so pleasant with us;  
His present and your pains we thank you for:  
When we have march'd our rackets to these balls,  
We will, in France, by God's grace, play a set  
Shall strike his father's crown into the hazard.  
Tell him he hath made a match with such a wrangler  
That all the courts of France will be disturb'd  
With chaces. And we understand him well,  
How he comes o'er us with our wilder days,  
Not measuring what use we made of them.  
We never valued this poor seat of England;  
And therefore, living hence, did give ourself  
To barbarous licence; as 'tis ever common  
That men are merriest when they are from home.  
But tell the Dauphin I will keep my state,  
Be like a king and show my sail of greatness  
When I do rouse me in my throne of France:  
For that I have laid by my majesty  
And plodded like a man for working-days,  
But I will rise there with so full a glory  
That I will dazzle all the eyes of France,  
Yea, strike the Dauphin blind to look on us.  
And tell the pleasant prince this mock of his  
Hath turn'd his balls to gun-stones; and his soul  
Shall stand sore charged for the wasteful vengeance  
That shall fly with them: for many a thousand widows  
Shall this his mock mock out of their dear husbands;  
Mock mothers from their sons, mock castles down;  
And some are yet ungotten and unborn  
That shall have cause to curse the Dauphin's scorn.  
But this lies all within the will of God,  
To whom I do appeal; and in whose name  
Tell you the Dauphin I am coming on,  
To venge me as I may and to put forth  
My rightful hand in a well-hallow'd cause.  
So get you hence in peace; and tell the Dauphin  
His jest will savour but of shallow wit,  
When thousands weep more than did laugh at it.  
Convey them with safe conduct. Fare you well.

*Exeunt Ambassador*

**EXETER**  
This was a merry message.

**KING HENRY V**  
We hope to make the sender blush at it.  
Therefore, my lords, omit no happy hour  
That may give furtherance to our expedition;  
For we have now no thought in us but France,  
Save those to God, that run before our business.  
Therefore let our proportions for these wars  
Be soon collected and all things thought upon  
That may with reasonable swiftness add  
More feathers to our wings; for, God before,  
We'll chide this Dauphin at his father's door.  
Therefore let every man now task his thought,  
That this fair action may on foot be brought.

*Exeunt. Flourish*

## ACT II

### PROLOGUE

*Enter Chorus*

**Chorus**  
Now all the youth of England are on fire,  
And silken dalliance in the wardrobe lies:  
Now thrive the armourers, and honour's thought  
Reigns solely in the breast of every man:  
They sell the pasture now to buy the horse,  
Following the mirror of all Christian kings,  
With winged heels, as English Mercuries.  
For now sits Expectation in the air,  
And hides a sword from hilts unto the point  
With crowns imperial, crowns and coronets,  
Promised to Harry and his followers.  
The French, advised by good intelligence  
Of this most dreadful preparation,  
Shake in their fear and with pale policy  
Seek to divert the English purposes.  
O England! model to thy inward greatness,  
Like little body with a mighty heart,  
What mightst thou do, that honour would thee do,  
Were all thy children kind and natural!

*Exit*

### SCENE I. London. A street.

*Enter Corporal NYM and Lieutenant BARDOLPH*

**BARDOLPH**  
Well met, Corporal Nym.

**NYM**  
Good morrow, Lieutenant Bardolph.

**BARDOLPH**  
What, are Ancient Pistol and you friends yet?

**NYM**  
For my part, I care not: I say little; but when  
time shall serve, there shall be smiles; but that  
shall be as it may. I dare not fight; but I will  
wink and hold out mine iron: it is a simple one; but  
what though? it will toast cheese, and it will  
endure cold as another man's sword will: and  
there's an end.

**BARDOLPH**  
I will bestow a breakfast to make you friends; and  
we'll be all three sworn brothers to France: let it  
be so, good Corporal Nym.

**NYM**  
Faith, I will live so long as I may, that's the  
certain of it; and when I cannot live any longer, I  
will do as I may: that is my rest, that is the  
rendezvous of it.

**BARDOLPH**  
It is certain, corporal, that he is married to Nell  
Quickly: and certainly she did you wrong; for you  
were troth-plight to her.

**NYM**  
I cannot tell: things must be as they may: men may  
sleep, and they may have their throats about them at  
that time; and some say knives have edges. It must  
be as it may: though patience be a tired mare, yet  
she will plod. There must be conclusions. Well, I  
cannot tell.

*Enter PISTOL and Hostess*

**BARDOLPH**  
Here comes Ancient Pistol and his wife: good  
corporal, be patient here. How now, mine host Pistol!

**PISTOL**  
Base tike, call'st thou me host? Now, by this hand,  
I swear, I scorn the term; Nor shall my Nell keep lodgers.

**Hostess**  
No, by my troth, not long; for we cannot lodge and  
board a dozen or fourteen gentlewomen that live  
honestly by the prick of their needles, but it will  
be thought we keep a bawdy house straight.

*NYM and PISTOL draw*

O well a day, Lady, if he be not drawn now! we  
shall see wilful adultery and murder committed.

**BARDOLPH**  
Good lieutenant! good corporal! offer nothing here.

**NYM**  
Pish!

**PISTOL**  
Pish for thee, Iceland dog! thou prick-ear'd cur of Iceland!

**Hostess**  
Good Corporal Nym, show thy valour, and put up your sword.

**NYM**  
Will you shog off? I would have you solus.

**PISTOL**  
'Solus,' egregious dog? O viper vile!  
The 'solus' in thy most mervailous face;  
The 'solus' in thy teeth, and in thy throat,  
And in thy hateful lungs, yea, in thy maw, perdy,  
And, which is worse, within thy nasty mouth!  
I do retort the 'solus' in thy bowels;  
For I can take, and Pistol's cock is up,  
And flashing fire will follow.

**NYM**  
I am not Barbason; you cannot conjure me. I have an  
humour to knock you indifferently well. If you grow  
foul with me, Pistol, I will scour you with my  
rapier, as I may, in fair terms: if you would walk  
off, I would prick your guts a little, in good  
terms, as I may: and that's the humour of it.

**PISTOL**  
O braggart vile and damned furious wight!  
The grave doth gape, and doting death is near;  
Therefore exhale.

**BARDOLPH**  
Hear me, hear me what I say: he that strikes the  
first stroke, I'll run him up to the hilts, as I am a soldier.

*Draws*

**PISTOL**  
An oath of mickle might; and fury shall abate.  
Give me thy fist, thy fore-foot to me give:  
Thy spirits are most tall.

**NYM**  
I will cut thy throat, one time or other, in fair  
terms: that is the humour of it.

**PISTOL**  
'Couple a gorge!'  
That is the word. I thee defy again.  
O hound of Crete, think'st thou my spouse to get?  
No; to the spital go,  
And from the powdering tub of infamy  
Fetch forth the lazar kite of Cressid's kind,  
Doll Tearsheet she by name, and her espouse:  
I have, and I will hold, the quondam Quickly  
For the only she; and--pauca, there's enough. Go to.

*Enter the Boy*

**Boy**  
Mine host Pistol, you must come to my master, and  
you, hostess: he is very sick, and would to bed.  
Good Bardolph, put thy face between his sheets, and  
do the office of a warming-pan. Faith, he's very ill.

**BARDOLPH**  
Away, you rogue!

**Hostess**  
By my troth, he'll yield the crow a pudding one of  
these days. The king has killed his heart. Good  
husband, come home presently.

*Exeunt Hostess and Boy*

**BARDOLPH**  
Come, shall I make you two friends? We must to  
France together: why the devil should we keep  
knives to cut one another's throats?

**PISTOL**  
Let floods o'erswell, and fiends for food howl on!

**NYM**  
You'll pay me the eight shillings I won of you at betting?

**PISTOL**  
Base is the slave that pays.

**NYM**  
That now I will have: that's the humour of it.

**PISTOL**  
As manhood shall compound: push home.

*They draw*

**BARDOLPH**  
By this sword, he that makes the first thrust, I'll  
kill him; by this sword, I will.

**PISTOL**  
Sword is an oath, and oaths must have their course.

**BARDOLPH**  
Corporal Nym, an thou wilt be friends, be friends:  
an thou wilt not, why, then, be enemies with me too.  
Prithee, put up.

**NYM**  
I shall have my eight shillings I won of you at betting?

**PISTOL**  
A noble shalt thou have, and present pay;  
And liquor likewise will I give to thee,  
And friendship shall combine, and brotherhood:  
I'll live by Nym, and Nym shall live by me;  
Is not this just? for I shall sutler be  
Unto the camp, and profits will accrue.  
Give me thy hand.

**NYM**  
I shall have my noble?

**PISTOL**  
In cash most justly paid.

**NYM**  
Well, then, that's the humour of't.

*Re-enter Hostess*

**Hostess**  
As ever you came of women, come in quickly to Sir  
John. Ah, poor heart! he is so shaked of a burning  
quotidian tertian, that it is most lamentable to  
behold. Sweet men, come to him.

**NYM**  
The king hath run bad humours on the knight; that's  
the even of it.

**PISTOL**  
Nym, thou hast spoke the right;  
His heart is fracted and corroborate.

**NYM**  
The king is a good king: but it must be as it may;  
he passes some humours and careers.

**PISTOL**  
Let us condole the knight; for, lambkins we will live.

### SCENE II. Southampton. A council-chamber.

*Trumpets sound. Enter KING HENRY V, EXETER, SCROOP, CAMBRIDGE, and
GREY*

**KING HENRY V**  
My Lord of Cambridge, and my kind Lord of Masham,  
And you, my gentle knight, give me your thoughts:  
Think you not that the powers we bear with us  
Will cut their passage through the force of France,  
Doing the execution and the act  
For which we have in head assembled them?

**SCROOP**  
No doubt, my liege, if each man do his best.

**KING HENRY V**  
I doubt not that; since we are well persuaded  
We carry not a heart with us from hence  
That grows not in a fair consent with ours,  
Nor leave not one behind that doth not wish  
Success and conquest to attend on us.

**CAMBRIDGE**  
Never was monarch better fear'd and loved  
Than is your majesty: there's not, I think, a subject  
That sits in heart-grief and uneasiness  
Under the sweet shade of your government.

**GREY**  
True: those that were your father's enemies  
Have steep'd their galls in honey and do serve you  
With hearts create of duty and of zeal.

**KING HENRY V**  
We therefore have great cause of thankfulness;  
And shall forget the office of our hand,  
Sooner than quittance of desert and merit  
According to the weight and worthiness.

**SCROOP**  
So service shall with steeled sinews toil,  
And labour shall refresh itself with hope,  
To do your grace incessant services.

**KING HENRY V**  
We judge no less. Uncle of Exeter,  
Enlarge the man committed yesterday,  
That rail'd against our person: we consider  
it was excess of wine that set him on;  
And on his more advice we pardon him.

**SCROOP**  
That's mercy, but too much security:  
Let him be punish'd, sovereign, lest example  
Breed, by his sufferance, more of such a kind.

**KING HENRY V**  
O, let us yet be merciful.

**CAMBRIDGE**  
So may your highness, and yet punish too.

**GREY**  
Sir,  
You show great mercy, if you give him life,  
After the taste of much correction.

**KING HENRY V**  
Alas, your too much love and care of me  
Are heavy orisons 'gainst this poor wretch!  
If little faults, proceeding on distemper,  
Shall not be wink'd at, how shall we stretch our eye  
When capital crimes, chew'd, swallow'd and digested,  
Appear before us? We'll yet enlarge that man,  
Though Cambridge, Scroop and Grey, in their dear care  
Would have him punished. And now to our French causes:  
Who are the late commissioners?

**CAMBRIDGE**  
I one, my lord:  
Your highness bade me ask for it to-day.

**SCROOP**  
So did you me, my liege.

**GREY**  
And I, my royal sovereign.

**KING HENRY V**  
Then, Richard Earl of Cambridge, there is yours;  
There yours, Lord Scroop of Masham; and, sir knight,  
Grey of Northumberland, this same is yours:  
Read them; and know, I know your worthiness.  
We will aboard tonight. Why, how now, gentlemen!  
What see you in those papers that you lose  
So much complexion? Look ye, how they change!

**CAMBRIDGE**  
I do confess my fault;  
And do submit me to your highness' mercy.

**SCROOP**  
To which we all appeal.

**KING HENRY V**  
The mercy that was quick in us but late,  
By your own counsel is suppress'd and kill'd:  
You must not dare, for shame, to talk of mercy;  
For your own reasons turn into your bosoms,  
As dogs upon their masters, worrying you.  
See you, my uncle! My Lord of Cambridge here,  
You know how apt our love was to accord  
To furnish him with all appertinents  
Belonging to his honour; and this man  
Hath, for a few light crowns, lightly conspired,  
And sworn unto the practises of France,  
To kill us here in Hampton: to the which  
This knight, no less for bounty bound to us  
Than Cambridge is, hath likewise sworn. But, O,  
What shall I say to thee, Lord Scroop? thou cruel,  
Ingrateful, savage and inhuman creature!  
Thou that didst bear the key of all my counsels,  
That knew'st the very bottom of my soul,  
Wouldst thou have practised on me for thy use,  
May it be possible, that foreign hire  
Could out of thee extract one spark of evil  
That might annoy my finger? 'tis so strange,  
That, though the truth of it stands off as gross  
As black and white, my eye will scarcely see it.  
And whatsoever cunning fiend it was  
That wrought upon thee so preposterously  
Hath got the voice in hell for excellence:  
Why, so didst thou: seem they grave and learned?  
Why, so didst thou: come they of noble family?  
Why, so didst thou: or are they spare in diet,  
Free from gross passion or of mirth or anger,  
Constant in spirit, not swerving with the blood,  
Garnish'd and deck'd in modest complement,  
Not working with the eye without the ear,  
And but in purged judgment trusting neither?  
Such and so finely bolted didst thou seem:  
And thus thy fall hath left a kind of blot,  
To mark the full-fraught man and best indued  
With some suspicion. I will weep for thee;  
For this revolt of thine, methinks, is like  
Another fall of man. Their faults are open:  
Arrest them to the answer of the law;  
And God acquit them of their practises!

**EXETER**  
I arrest thee of high treason, by the name of  
Richard Earl of Cambridge.  
I arrest thee of high treason, by the name of  
Henry Lord Scroop of Masham.  
I arrest thee of high treason, by the name of  
Thomas Grey, knight, of Northumberland.

**SCROOP**  
Our purposes God justly hath discover'd;  
And I repent my fault more than my death;  
Which I beseech your highness to forgive,  
Although my body pay the price of it.

**CAMBRIDGE**  
For me, the gold of France did not seduce;  
Although I did admit it as a motive  
The sooner to effect what I intended:  
But God be thanked for prevention;  
Which I in sufferance heartily will rejoice,  
Beseeching God and you to pardon me.

**GREY**  
Never did faithful subject more rejoice  
At the discovery of most dangerous treason  
Than I do at this hour joy o'er myself.  
Prevented from a damned enterprise:  
My fault, but not my body, pardon, sovereign.

**KING HENRY V**  
You have conspired against our royal person,  
Join'd with an enemy proclaim'd and from his coffers  
Received the golden earnest of our death;  
Wherein you would have sold your king to slaughter,  
His subjects to oppression and contempt  
And his whole kingdom into desolation.  
Touching our person seek we no revenge;  
But we our kingdom's safety must so tender,  
Whose ruin you have sought, that to her laws  
We do deliver you. Get you therefore hence,  
Poor miserable wretches, to your death:

*Exeunt CAMBRIDGE, GREY, and SCROOP, guarded by EXETER*

Now, lords, for France; the enterprise whereof  
Shall be to you, as us, like glorious.  
We doubt not of a fair and lucky war,  
Since God so graciously hath brought to light  
This dangerous treason lurking in our way  
To hinder our beginnings. We doubt not now  
But every rub is smoothed on our way.  
Then forth, dear countrymen: let us deliver  
Our puissance into the hand of God,  
Putting it straight in expedition.  
Cheerly to sea; the signs of war advance:  
No king of England, if not king of France.

*Exeunt*

### SCENE III. London. Before a tavern.

*Enter PISTOL, Hostess, NYM, BARDOLPH, and Boy*

**Hostess**  
Prithee, honey-sweet husband, let me bring thee to Staines.

**PISTOL**  
No; for my manly heart doth yearn.  
Bardolph, be blithe: Nym, rouse thy vaunting veins:  
Boy, bristle thy courage up; for Falstaff he is dead,  
And we must yearn therefore.

**BARDOLPH**  
Would I were with him, wheresome'er he is, either in  
heaven or in hell!

**Hostess**  
Nay, sure, he's not in hell: he's in Arthur's  
bosom, if ever man went to Arthur's bosom. A' made  
a finer end and went away an it had been any  
christom child; a' parted even just between twelve  
and one, even at the turning o' the tide: for after  
I saw him fumble with the sheets and play with  
flowers and smile upon his fingers' ends, I knew  
there was but one way; for his nose was as sharp as  
a pen, and a' babbled of green fields. 'How now,  
sir John!' quoth I 'what, man! be o' good  
cheer.' So a' cried out 'God, God, God!' three or  
four times. Now I, to comfort him, bid him a'  
should not think of God; I hoped there was no need  
to trouble himself with any such thoughts yet. So  
a' bade me lay more clothes on his feet: I put my  
hand into the bed and felt them, and they were as  
cold as any stone; then I felt to his knees, and  
they were as cold as any stone, and so upward and  
upward, and all was as cold as any stone.

**NYM**  
They say he cried out of sack.

**Hostess**  
Ay, that a' did.

**BARDOLPH**  
And of women.

**Hostess**  
Nay, that a' did not.

**Boy**  
Yes, that a' did; and said they were devils  
incarnate.

**Hostess**  
A' could never abide carnation; 'twas a colour he  
never liked.

**Boy**  
A' said once, the devil would have him about women.

**Hostess**  
A' did in some sort, indeed, handle women; but then  
he was rheumatic, and talked of the whore of Babylon.

**Boy**  
Do you not remember, a' saw a flea stick upon  
Bardolph's nose, and a' said it was a black soul  
burning in hell-fire?

**BARDOLPH**  
Well, the fuel is gone that maintained that fire:  
that's all the riches I got in his service.

**NYM**  
Shall we shog? the king will be gone from  
Southampton.

**PISTOL**  
Come, let's away. My love, give me thy lips.  
Look to my chattels and my movables:  
Let senses rule; the word is 'Pitch and Pay:'  
Trust none;  
For oaths are straws, men's faiths are wafer-cakes,  
And hold-fast is the only dog, my duck:  
Therefore, Caveto be thy counsellor.  
Go, clear thy c rystals. Yoke-fellows in arms,  
Let us to France; like horse-leeches, my boys,  
To suck, to suck, the very blood to suck!

**Boy**  
And that's but unwholesome food they say.

**PISTOL**  
Touch her soft mouth, and march.

**BARDOLPH**  
Farewell, hostess.

*Kissing her*

**NYM**  
I cannot kiss, that is the humour of it; but, adieu.

**PISTOL**  
Let housewifery appear: keep close, I thee command.

**Hostess**  
Farewell; adieu.

*Exeunt*

### SCENE IV. France. The KING'S palace.

*Flourish. Enter the FRENCH KING, the DAUPHIN, and the Constable*

**KING OF FRANCE**  
Thus comes the English with full power upon us;  
And more than carefully it us concerns  
To answer royally in our defences.  
Therefore the Dukes of Berri and of Bretagne,  
Of Brabant and of Orleans, shall make forth,  
And you, Prince Dauphin, with all swift dispatch,  
To line and new repair our towns of war  
With men of courage and with means defendant;  
For England his approaches makes as fierce  
As waters to the sucking of a gulf.  
It fits us then to be as provident  
As fear may teach us out of late examples  
Left by the fatal and neglected English  
Upon our fields.

**DAUPHIN**  
My most redoubted father,  
It is most meet we arm us 'gainst the foe;  
For peace itself should not so dull a kingdom,  
Though war nor no known quarrel were in question,  
But that defences, musters, preparations,  
Should be maintain'd, assembled and collected,  
As were a war in expectation.  
Therefore, I say 'tis meet we all go forth  
To view the sick and feeble parts of France:  
And let us do it with no show of fear;  
No, with no more than if we heard that England  
Were busied with a Whitsun morris-dance:  
For, my good liege, she is so idly king'd,  
Her sceptre so fantastically borne  
By a vain, giddy, shallow, humorous youth,  
That fear attends her not.

**Constable**  
O peace, Prince Dauphin!  
You are too much mistaken in this king:  
Question your grace the late ambassadors,  
With what great state he heard their embassy,  
How well supplied with noble counsellors,  
How modest in exception, and withal  
How terrible in constant resolution,  
And you shall find his vanities forespent  
Were but the outside of the Roman Brutus,  
Covering discretion with a coat of folly;  
As gardeners do with ordure hide those roots  
That shall first spring and be most delicate.

**DAUPHIN**  
Well, 'tis not so, my lord high constable;  
But though we think it so, it is no matter:  
In cases of defence 'tis best to weigh  
The enemy more mighty than he seems:  
So the proportions of defence are fill'd;  
Which of a weak or niggardly projection  
Doth, like a miser, spoil his coat with scanting  
A little cloth.

**KING OF FRANCE**  
Think we King Harry strong;  
And, princes, look you strongly arm to meet him.  
The kindred of him hath been flesh'd upon us;  
And he is bred out of that bloody strain  
That haunted us in our familiar paths:  
Witness our too much memorable shame  
When Cressy battle fatally was struck,  
And all our princes captiv'd by the hand  
Of that black name, Edward, Black Prince of Wales;  
Whiles that his mountain sire, on mountain standing,  
Up in the air, crown'd with the golden sun,  
Saw his heroical seed, and smiled to see him,  
Mangle the work of nature and deface  
The patterns that by God and by French fathers  
Had twenty years been made. This is a stem  
Of that victorious stock; and let us fear  
The native mightiness and fate of him.

*Enter a Messenger*

**Messenger**  
Ambassadors from Harry King of England  
Do crave admittance to your majesty.

**KING OF FRANCE**  
We'll give them present audience. Go, and bring them.

*Exeunt Messenger and Constable*

You see this chase is hotly follow'd, boy.

**DAUPHIN**  
Turn head, and stop pursuit; for coward dogs  
Most spend their mouths when what they seem to threaten  
Runs far before them. Good my sovereign,  
Take up the English short, and let them know  
Of what a monarchy you are the head:  
Self-love, my liege, is not so vile a sin  
As self-neglecting.

*Re-enter Constable, with EXETER*

**KING OF FRANCE**  
From our brother England?

**EXETER**  
From him; and thus he greets your majesty.  
He wills you, in the name of God Almighty,  
That you divest yourself, and lay apart  
The borrow'd glories that by gift of heaven,  
By law of nature and of nations, 'long  
To him and to his heirs; namely, the crown  
And all wide-stretched honours that pertain  
By custom and the ordinance of times  
Unto the crown of France. That you may know  
'Tis no sinister nor no awkward claim,  
Pick'd from the worm-holes of long-vanish'd days,  
Nor from the dust of old oblivion raked,  
He sends you this most memorable line,  
In every branch truly demonstrative;  
Willing to overlook this pedigree:  
And when you find him evenly derived  
From his most famed of famous ancestors,  
Edward the Third, he bids you then resign  
Your crown and kingdom, indirectly held  
From him the native and true challenger.

**KING OF FRANCE**  
Or else what follows?

**EXETER**  
Bloody constraint; for if you hide the crown  
Even in your hearts, there will he rake for it.

**KING OF FRANCE**  
For us, we will consider of this further:  
To-morrow shall you bear our full intent  
Back to our brother England.

**DAUPHIN**  
For the Dauphin,  
I stand here for him: what to him from England?

**EXETER**  
Scorn and defiance; slight regard, contempt,  
And any thing that may not misbecome  
The mighty sender, doth he prize you at.  
Thus says my king; an' if your father's highness  
Do not, in grant of all demands at large,  
Sweeten the bitter mock you sent his majesty,  
He'll call you to so hot an answer of it,  
That caves and womby vaultages of France  
Shall chide your trespass and return your mock  
In second accent of his ordnance.

**DAUPHIN**  
Say, if my father render fair return,  
It is against my will; for I desire  
Nothing but odds with England: to that end,  
As matching to his youth and vanity,  
I did present him with the Paris balls.

**EXETER**  
He'll make your Paris Louvre shake for it,  
Were it the mistress-court of mighty Europe:  
And, be assured, you'll find a difference,  
As we his subjects have in wonder found,  
Between the promise of his greener days  
And these he masters now: now he weighs time  
Even to the utmost grain: that you shall read  
In your own losses, if he stay in France.

**KING OF FRANCE**  
To-morrow shall you know our mind at full.

**EXETER**  
Dispatch us with all speed, lest that our king  
Come here himself to question our delay;  
For he is footed in this land already.

**KING OF FRANCE**  
You shall be soon dispatch's with fair conditions:  
A night is but small breath and little pause  
To answer matters of this consequence.

*Flourish. Exeunt*

## ACT III

### PROLOGUE

*Enter Chorus*

**Chorus**  
Thus with imagined wing our swift scene flies  
In motion of no less celerity  
Than that of thought. Suppose that you have seen  
The well-appointed king at Hampton pier  
Embark his royalty; and his brave fleet  
With silken streamers the young Phoebus fanning:  
Grapple your minds to sternage of this navy,  
And leave your England, as dead midnight still,  
Guarded with grandsires, babies and old women,  
Either past or not arrived to pith and puissance;  
For who is he, whose chin is but enrich'd  
With one appearing hair, that will not follow  
These cull'd and choice-drawn cavaliers to France?  
Work, work your thoughts, and therein see a siege;  
Behold the ordnance on their carriages,  
With fatal mouths gaping on girded Harfleur.  
Suppose the ambassador from the French comes back;  
Tells Harry that the king doth offer him  
Katharine his daughter, and with her, to dowry,  
Some petty and unprofitable dukedoms.  
The offer likes not: and the nimble gunner  
With linstock now the devilish cannon touches,

*Alarum, and chambers go off*

And down goes all before them. Still be kind,  
And eke out our performance with your mind.

*Exit*

### SCENE I. France. Before Harfleur.

*Alarum. Enter KING HENRY*

**KING HENRY V**  
Once more unto the breach, dear friends, once more;  
Or close the wall up with our English dead.  
In peace there's nothing so becomes a man  
As modest stillness and humility:  
But when the blast of war blows in our ears,  
Then imitate the action of the tiger;  
Stiffen the sinews, summon up the blood,  
Disguise fair nature with hard-favour'd rage;  
Then lend the eye a terrible aspect;  
Let pry through the portage of the head  
Like the brass cannon; let the brow o'erwhelm it  
As fearfully as doth a galled rock  
O'erhang and jutty his confounded base,  
Swill'd with the wild and wasteful ocean.  
Now set the teeth and stretch the nostril wide,  
Hold hard the breath and bend up every spirit  
To his full height. On, on, you noblest English.  
Fathers that, like so many Alexanders,  
Have in these parts from morn till even fought  
And sheathed their swords for lack of argument:  
Dishonour not your mothers; now attest  
That those whom you call'd fathers did beget you.  
Be copy now to men of grosser blood,  
And teach them how to war. And you, good yeoman,  
Whose limbs were made in England, show us here  
The mettle of your pasture; let us swear  
That you are worth your breeding; which I doubt not;  
For there is none of you so mean and base,  
That hath not noble lustre in your eyes.  
I see you stand like greyhounds in the slips,  
Straining upon the start. The game's afoot:  
Follow your spirit, and upon this charge  
Cry 'God for Harry, England, and Saint George!'

*Exeunt. Alarum, and chambers go off*

### SCENE II. The same.

*Enter NYM, BARDOLPH, PISTOL, and Boy*

**BARDOLPH**  
On, on, on, on, on! to the breach, to the breach!

**NYM**  
Pray thee, corporal, stay: the knocks are too hot;  
and, for mine own part, I have not a case of lives:  
the humour of it is too hot, that is the very  
plain-song of it.

**PISTOL**  
The plain-song is most just: for humours do abound:  
Knocks go and come; God's vassals drop and die;  
And sword and shield,  
In bloody field,  
Doth win immortal fame.

**Boy**  
Would I were in an alehouse in London! I would give  
all my fame for a pot of ale and safety.

**PISTOL**  
And I:  
If wishes would prevail with me,  
My purpose should not fail with me,  
But thither would I hie.

**Boy**  
As duly, but not as truly,  
As bird doth sing on bough.

*Enter FLUELLEN*

**FLUELLEN**  
Up to the breach, you dogs! avaunt, you cullions!

*Driving them forward*

**PISTOL**  
Be merciful, great duke, to men of mould.  
Abate thy rage, abate thy manly rage,  
Abate thy rage, great duke!  
Good bawcock, bate thy rage; use lenity, sweet chuck!

**NYM**  
These be good humours! your honour wins bad humours.

*Exeunt all but FLUELLEN*

*Enter Gower*

**GOWER**  
Captain Fluellen, you must come presently to the  
mines; the Duke of Gloucester would speak with you.

**FLUELLEN**  
To the mines! tell you the duke, it is not so good  
to come to the mines; for, look you, the mines is  
not according to the disciplines of the war: the  
concavities of it is not sufficient; for, look you,  
the athversary, you may discuss unto the duke, look  
you, is digt himself four yard under the  
countermines: by Cheshu, I think a' will plough up  
all, if there is not better directions.

**GOWER**  
The Duke of Gloucester, to whom the order of the  
siege is given, is altogether directed by an  
Irishman, a very valiant gentleman, i' faith.

**FLUELLEN**  
It is Captain Macmorris, is it not?

**GOWER**  
I think it be.

**FLUELLEN**  
By Cheshu, he is an ass, as in the world: I will  
verify as much in his beard: be has no more  
directions in the true disciplines of the wars, look  
you, of the Roman disciplines, than is a puppy-dog.

*A parley sounded*

**GOWER**  
The town sounds a parley.

*Exeunt*

### SCENE III. The same. Before the gates.

*The Governor on the walls; the English forces below. Enter KING HENRY*

**KING HENRY V**  
How yet resolves the governor of the town?  
This is the latest parle we will admit;  
Therefore to our best mercy give yourselves;  
Or like to men proud of destruction  
Defy us to our worst: for, as I am a soldier,  
I will not leave the half-achieved Harfleur  
Till in her ashes she lie buried.  
The gates of mercy shall be all shut up,  
And the flesh'd soldier, rough and hard of heart,  
In liberty of bloody hand shall range  
With conscience wide as hell, mowing like grass  
Your fresh-fair virgins and your flowering infants.  
What is't to me, when you yourselves are cause,  
If your pure maidens fall into the hand  
Of hot and forcing violation?  
We may as bootless spend our vain command  
Upon the enraged soldiers in their spoil  
As send precepts to the leviathan  
To come ashore. Therefore, you men of Harfleur,  
Take pity of your town and of your people,  
Whiles yet my soldiers are in my command;  
What say you? will you yield, and this avoid,  
Or, guilty in defence, be thus destroy'd?

**GOVERNOR**  
Our expectation hath this day an end:  
The Dauphin, whom of succors we entreated,  
Returns us that his powers are yet not ready  
To raise so great a siege. Therefore, great king,  
We yield our town and lives to thy soft mercy.  
Enter our gates; dispose of us and ours;  
For we no longer are defensible.

*Enter Exeter*

**KING HENRY V**  
Open your gates. Come, uncle Exeter,  
Go you and enter Harfleur; there remain,  
And fortify it strongly 'gainst the French:  
Use mercy to them all. For us, dear uncle,  
The winter coming on and sickness growing  
Upon our soldiers, we will retire to Calais.  
To-night in Harfleur we will be your guest;  
To-morrow for the march are we addrest.

*Flourish. The King and his train enter the town*

### SCENE IV. The FRENCH KING's palace.

*Enter KATHARINE and ALICE*

**KATHARINE**  
Alice, tu as ete en Angleterre, et tu parles bien le langage.

**ALICE**  
Un peu, madame.

**KATHARINE**  
Je te prie, m'enseignez: il faut que j'apprenne a  
parler. Comment appelez-vous la main en Anglois?

**ALICE**  
La main? elle est appelee de hand.

**KATHARINE**  
De hand. Et les doigts?

**ALICE**  
Les doigts? ma foi, j'oublie les doigts; mais je me  
souviendrai. Les doigts? je pense qu'ils sont  
appeles de fingres; oui, de fingres.

**KATHARINE**  
La main, de hand; les doigts, de fingres. Je pense  
que je suis le bon ecolier; j'ai gagne deux mots  
d'Anglois vitement. Comment appelez-vous les ongles?

**ALICE**  
Les ongles? nous les appelons de nails.

**KATHARINE**  
De nails. Ecoutez; dites-moi, si je parle bien: de  
hand, de fingres, et de nails.

**ALICE**  
C'est bien dit, madame; il est fort bon Anglois.

**KATHARINE**  
Dites-moi l'Anglois pour le bras.

**ALICE**  
De arm, madame.

**KATHARINE**  
Et le coude?

**ALICE**  
De elbow.

**KATHARINE**  
De elbow. Je m'en fais la repetition de tous les  
mots que vous m'avez appris des a present.

**ALICE**  
Il est trop difficile, madame, comme je pense.

**KATHARINE**  
Excusez-moi, Alice; ecoutez: de hand, de fingres,  
de nails, de arma, de bilbow.

**ALICE**  
De elbow, madame.

**KATHARINE**  
O Seigneur Dieu, je m'en oublie! de elbow. Comment  
appelez-vous le col?

**ALICE**  
De neck, madame.

**KATHARINE**  
De nick. Et le menton?

**ALICE**  
De chin.

**KATHARINE**  
De sin. Le col, de nick; de menton, de sin.

**ALICE**  
Oui. Sauf votre honneur, en verite, vous prononcez  
les mots aussi droit que les natifs d'Angleterre.

**KATHARINE**  
Je ne doute point d'apprendre, par la grace de Dieu,  
et en peu de temps.

**ALICE**  
N'avez vous pas deja oublie ce que je vous ai enseigne?

**KATHARINE**  
Non, je reciterai a vous promptement: de hand, de  
fingres, de mails--

**ALICE**  
De nails, madame.

**KATHARINE**  
De nails, de arm, de ilbow.

**ALICE**  
Sauf votre honneur, de elbow.

**KATHARINE**  
Ainsi dis-je; de elbow, de nick, et de sin. Comment  
appelez-vous le pied et la robe?

**ALICE**  
De foot, madame; et de coun.

**KATHARINE**  
De foot et de coun! O Seigneur Dieu! ce sont mots  
de son mauvais, corruptible, gros, et impudique, et  
non pour les dames d'honneur d'user: je ne voudrais  
prononcer ces mots devant les seigneurs de France  
pour tout le monde. Foh! le foot et le coun!  
Neanmoins, je reciterai une autre fois ma lecon  
ensemble: de hand, de fingres, de nails, de arm, de  
elbow, de nick, de sin, de foot, de coun.

**ALICE**  
Excellent, madame!

**KATHARINE**  
C'est assez pour une fois: allons-nous a diner.

*Exeunt*

### SCENE V. The same.

*Enter the KING OF FRANCE, the DAUPHIN, and the Constable of France*

**KING OF FRANCE**  
'Tis certain he hath pass'd the river Somme.

**Constable**  
And if he be not fought withal, my lord,  
Let us not live in France; let us quit all  
And give our vineyards to a barbarous people.  
Dieu de batailles! where have they this mettle?  
Is not their climate foggy, raw and dull,  
On whom, as in despite, the sun looks pale,  
Killing their fruit with frowns?

**DAUPHIN**  
By faith and honour,  
Our madams mock at us, and plainly say  
Our mettle is bred out and they will give  
Their bodies to the lust of English youth  
To new-store France with bastard warriors.

**Constable**  
They bid us to the English dancing-schools,  
And teach lavoltas high and swift corantos;  
Saying our grace is only in our heels,  
And that we are most lofty runaways.

**KING OF FRANCE**  
Where is Montjoy the herald? speed him hence:  
Let him greet England with our sharp defiance.  
Up, princes! and, with spirit of honour edged  
More sharper than your swords, hie to the field:  
Bar Harry England, that sweeps through our land  
With pennons painted in the blood of Harfleur:  
Rush on his host, as doth the melted snow  
Upon the valleys, whose low vassal seat  
The Alps doth spit and void his rheum upon:  
Go down upon him, you have power enough,  
And in a captive chariot into Rouen  
Bring him our prisoner.

**Constable**  
This becomes the great.  
Sorry am I his numbers are so few,  
His soldiers sick and famish'd in their march,  
For I am sure, when he shall see our army,  
He'll drop his heart into the sink of fear  
And for achievement offer us his ransom.

**KING OF FRANCE**  
Therefore, lord constable, haste on Montjoy.  
And let him say to England that we send  
To know what willing ransom he will give.  
Prince Dauphin, you shall stay with us in Rouen.

**DAUPHIN**  
Not so, I do beseech your majesty.

**KING OF FRANCE**  
Be patient, for you shall remain with us.  
Now forth, lord constable and princes all,  
And quickly bring us word of England's fall.

*Exeunt*

### SCENE VI. The English camp in Picardy.

*Enter GOWER and FLUELLEN, meeting*

*Enter PISTOL*

**PISTOL**  
Captain, I thee beseech to do me favours:  
The Duke of Exeter doth love thee well.

**FLUELLEN**  
Ay, I praise God; and I have merited some love at  
his hands.

**PISTOL**  
Bardolph, a soldier, firm and sound of heart,  
And of buxom valour, hath, by cruel fate,  
And giddy Fortune's furious fickle wheel,  
That goddess blind,  
That stands upon the rolling restless stone--

**FLUELLEN**  
By your patience, Aunchient Pistol. Fortune is  
painted blind, with a muffler afore her eyes, to  
signify to you that Fortune is blind; and she is  
painted also with a wheel, to signify to you, which  
is the moral of it, that she is turning, and  
inconstant, and mutability, and variation: and her  
foot, look you, is fixed upon a spherical stone,  
which rolls, and rolls, and rolls: in good truth,  
the poet makes a most excellent description of it:  
Fortune is an excellent moral.

**PISTOL**  
Fortune is Bardolph's foe, and frowns on him;  
For he hath stolen a pax, and hanged must a' be:  
A damned death!  
Let gallows gape for dog; let man go free  
And let not hemp his wind-pipe suffocate:  
But Exeter hath given the doom of death  
For pax of little price.  
Therefore, go speak: the duke will hear thy voice:  
And let not Bardolph's vital thread be cut  
With edge of penny cord and vile reproach:  
Speak, captain, for his life, and I will thee requite.

**FLUELLEN**  
Aunchient Pistol, I do partly understand your meaning.

**PISTOL**  
Why then, rejoice therefore.

**FLUELLEN**  
Certainly, aunchient, it is not a thing to rejoice  
at: for if, look you, he were my brother, I would  
desire the duke to use his good pleasure, and put  
him to execution; for discipline ought to be used.

**PISTOL**  
Die and be damn'd! and figo for thy friendship!

**FLUELLEN**  
It is well.

**PISTOL**  
The fig of Spain!

*Exit*

**FLUELLEN**  
Very good.

**GOWER**  
Why, this is an arrant counterfeit rascal; I  
remember him now; a bawd, a cutpurse.

*Drum heard*

**FLUELLEN**  
Hark you, the king is coming, and I must speak with  
him from the pridge.

*Drum and colours. Enter KING HENRY*

God pless your majesty!

**KING HENRY V**  
How now, Fluellen! camest thou from the bridge?

**FLUELLEN**  
Ay, so please your majesty. The Duke of Exeter has  
very gallantly maintained the pridge: the French is  
gone off, look you; and there is gallant and most  
prave passages; marry, th' athversary was have  
possession of the pridge; but he is enforced to  
retire, and the Duke of Exeter is master of the  
pridge: I can tell your majesty, the duke is a  
prave man.

**KING HENRY V**  
What men have you lost, Fluellen?

**FLUELLEN**  
The perdition of th' athversary hath been very  
great, reasonable great: marry, for my part, I  
think the duke hath lost never a man, but one that  
is like to be executed for robbing a church, one  
Bardolph, if your majesty know the man: his face is  
all bubukles, and whelks, and knobs, and flames o'  
fire: and his lips blows at his nose, and it is like  
a coal of fire, sometimes plue and sometimes red;  
but his nose is executed and his fire's out.

*Tucket. Enter MONTJOY*

**MONTJOY**  
You know me by my habit.

**KING HENRY V**  
Well then I know thee: what shall I know of thee?

**MONTJOY**  
My master's mind.

**KING HENRY V**  
Unfold it.

**MONTJOY**  
Thus says my king: Say thou to Harry of England:  
Though we seemed dead, we did but sleep: advantage  
is a better soldier than rashness. Tell him we  
could have rebuked him at Harfleur, but that we  
thought not good to bruise an injury till it were  
full ripe: now we speak upon our cue, and our voice  
is imperial: England shall repent his folly, see  
his weakness, and admire our sufferance. Bid him  
therefore consider of his ransom; which must  
proportion the losses we have borne, the subjects we  
have lost, the disgrace we have digested; which in  
weight to re-answer, his pettiness would bow under.

**KING HENRY V**  
What is thy name? I know thy quality.

**MONTJOY**  
Montjoy.

**KING HENRY V**  
Thou dost thy office fairly. Turn thee back.  
And tell thy king I do not seek him now;  
But could be willing to march on to Calais  
Without impeachment: for, to say the sooth,  
My people are with sickness much enfeebled,  
My numbers lessened, and those few I have  
Almost no better than so many French;  
Who when they were in health, I tell thee, herald,  
I thought upon one pair of English legs  
Did march three Frenchmen. Yet, forgive me, God,  
That I do brag thus! I must repent.  
Go therefore, tell thy master here I am;  
My army but a weak and sickly guard;  
Yet, God before, tell him we will come on,  
Though France himself and such another neighbour  
Stand in our way. There's for thy labour, Montjoy.  
If we may pass, we will; if we be hinder'd,  
We shall your tawny ground with your red blood  
Discolour: and so Montjoy, fare you well.  
We would not seek a battle, as we are;  
Nor, as we are, we say we will not shun it.

**MONTJOY**  
I shall deliver so. Thanks to your highness.

*Exeunt*

### SCENE VII. The French camp, near Agincourt:

*Enter the Constable of France, and the Duchess of ORLEANS*

**ORLEANS**  
The Dauphin longs for morning.

**RAMBURES**  
He longs to eat the English.

**Constable**  
I think he will eat all he kills.

**ORLEANS**  
By the white hand of my lady, he's a gallant prince.

**Constable**  
Swear by her foot, that she may tread out the oath.

**ORLEANS**  
He is simply the most active gentleman of France.

**Constable**  
Doing is activity; and he will still be doing.

**ORLEANS**  
He never did harm, that I heard of.

**Constable**  
Nor will do none to-morrow: he will keep that good name still.

**ORLEANS**  
I know him to be valiant.

**Constable**  
I was told that by one that knows him better than  
you.

**ORLEANS**  
What's he?

**Constable**  
Marry, he told me so himself; and he said he cared  
not who knew it

**ORLEANS**  
He needs not; it is no hidden virtue in him.

**Constable**  
By my faith, sir, but it is; never any body saw it  
but his lackey: 'tis a hooded valour; and when it  
appears, it will bate.

**ORLEANS**  
Ill will never said well.

**Constable**  
I will cap that proverb with 'There is flattery in friendship.'

**ORLEANS**  
And I will take up that with 'Give the devil his due.'

**Constable**  
Well placed: there stands your friend for the  
devil: have at the very eye of that proverb with 'A  
pox of the devil.'

**ORLEANS**  
You are the better at proverbs, by how much 'A  
fool's bolt is soon shot.'

**Constable**  
You have shot over.

**ORLEANS**  
'Tis not the first time you were overshot.

*Enter a Messenger*

**Messenger**  
My lord high constable, the English lie within  
fifteen hundred paces of your tents.

**Constable**  
Who hath measured the ground?

**Messenger**  
The Lord Grandpre.

**Constable**  
A valiant and most expert gentleman. Would it were  
day! Alas, poor Harry of England! he longs not for  
the dawning as we do.

**ORLEANS**  
What a wretched and peevish fellow is this king of  
England, to mope with his fat-brained followers so  
far out of his knowledge!

**Constable**  
If the English had any apprehension, they would run away.

**ORLEANS**  
That they lack; for if their heads had any  
intellectual armour, they could never wear such heavy  
head-pieces.

**RAMBURES**  
That island of England breeds very valiant  
creatures; their mastiffs are of unmatchable courage.

**ORLEANS**  
Foolish curs, that run winking into the mouth of a  
Russian bear and have their heads crushed like  
rotten apples! You may as well say, that's a  
valiant flea that dare eat his breakfast on the lip of a lion.

**Constable**  
Just, just; and the men do sympathize with the  
mastiffs in robustious and rough coming on, leaving  
their wits with their wives: and then give them  
great meals of beef and iron and steel, they will  
eat like wolves and fight like devils.

**ORLEANS**  
Ay, but these English are shrewdly out of beef.

**Constable**  
Then shall we find to-morrow they have only stomachs  
to eat and none to fight. Now is it time to arm:  
come, shall we about it?

**ORLEANS**  
It is now two o'clock: but, let me see, by ten  
We shall have each a hundred Englishmen.

*Exeunt*

## INTERMISSION

## ACT IV

### PROLOGUE

*Enter Chorus*

**Chorus**  
Now entertain conjecture of a time  
When creeping murmur and the poring dark  
Fills the wide vessel of the universe.  
From camp to camp through the foul womb of night  
The hum of either army stilly sounds,  
That the fixed sentinels almost receive  
The secret whispers of each other's watch:  
Fire answers fire, and through their paly flames  
Each battle sees the other's umber'd face;  
Steed threatens steed, in high and boastful neighs  
Piercing the night's dull ear, and from the tents  
The armourers, accomplishing the knights,  
With busy hammers closing rivets up,  
Give dreadful note of preparation:  
The country cocks do crow, the clocks do toll,  
And the third hour of drowsy morning name.  
Proud of their numbers and secure in soul,  
The confident and over-lusty French  
Do the low-rated English play at dice;  
And chide the cripple tardy-gaited night  
Who, like a foul and ugly witch, doth limp  
So tediously away. The poor condemned English,  
Like sacrifices, by their watchful fires  
Sit patiently and inly ruminate  
The morning's danger, and their gesture sad  
Investing lank-lean; cheeks and war-worn coats  
Presenteth them unto the gazing moon  
So many horrid ghosts. O now, who will behold  
The royal captain of this ruin'd band  
Walking from watch to watch, from tent to tent,  
Let him cry 'Praise and glory on his head!'  
For forth he goes and visits all his host.  
Bids them good morrow with a modest smile  
And calls them brothers, friends and countrymen.  
Upon his royal face there is no note  
How dread an army hath enrounded him;  
Nor doth he dedicate one jot of colour  
Unto the weary and all-watched night,  
But freshly looks and over-bears attaint  
With cheerful semblance and sweet majesty;  
That every wretch, pining and pale before,  
Beholding him, plucks comfort from his looks:  
A largess universal like the sun  
His liberal eye doth give to everyone,  
Thawing cold fear, that mean and gentle all,  
Behold, as may unworthiness define,  
A little touch of Harry in the night.  
And so our scene must to the battle fly;  
Where--O for pity!--we shall much disgrace  
With four or five most vile and ragged foils,  
Right ill-disposed in brawl ridiculous,  
The name of Agincourt. Yet sit and see,  
Minding true things by what their mockeries be.

*Exit*

### SCENE I. The English camp at Agincourt.

*Enter KING HENRY, alone.*

*Enter PISTOL*

**PISTOL**  
Qui va la?

**KING HENRY V**  
A friend.

**PISTOL**  
Discuss unto me; art thou officer?  
Or art thou base, common and popular?

**KING HENRY V**  
I am a gentleman of a company.

**PISTOL**  
Trail'st thou the puissant pike?

**KING HENRY V**  
Even so. What are you?

**PISTOL**  
As good a gentleman as the emperor.

**KING HENRY V**  
Then you are a better than the king.

**PISTOL**  
The king's a bawcock, and a heart of gold,  
A lad of life, an imp of fame;  
Of parents good, of fist most valiant.  
I kiss his dirty shoe, and from heart-string  
I love the lovely bully. What is thy name?

**KING HENRY V**  
Harry le Roy.

**PISTOL**  
Le Roy! a Cornish name: art thou of Cornish crew?

**PISTOL**  
Know'st thou Fluellen?

**KING HENRY V**  
Yes.

**PISTOL**  
Tell him, I'll knock his leek about his pate  
Upon Saint Davy's day.

**KING HENRY V**  
Do not you wear your dagger in your cap that day,  
lest he knock that about yours.

**PISTOL**  
Art thou his friend?

**KING HENRY V**  
And his kinsman too.

**PISTOL**  
The figo for thee, then!

**KING HENRY V**  
I thank you: God be with you!

**PISTOL**  
My name is Pistol call'd.

*Exit*

**KING HENRY V**  
It sorts well with your fierceness.

*Enter three soldiers, JOHN BATES, ALEXANDER COURT, and MICHAEL
WILLIAMS*

**COURT**  
Brother John Bates, is not that the morning which  
breaks yonder?

**BATES**  
I think it be: but we have no great cause to desire  
the approach of day.

**WILLIAMS**  
We see yonder the beginning of the day, but I think  
we shall never see the end of it. Who goes there?

**KING HENRY V**  
A friend.

**WILLIAMS**  
Under what captain serve you?

**KING HENRY V**  
Under Sir Thomas Erpingham.

**WILLIAMS**  
A good old commander and a most kind gentleman: I  
pray you, what thinks he of our estate?

**KING HENRY V**  
Even as men wrecked upon a sand, that look to be  
washed off the next tide.

**BATES**  
He hath not told his thought to the king?

**KING HENRY V**  
No; nor it is not meet he should. For, though I  
speak it to you, I think the king is but a man, as I  
am: therefore when he sees reason of fears, as we  
do, his fears, out of doubt, be of the same relish  
as ours are: yet, in reason, no man should possess  
him with any appearance of fear, lest he, by showing  
it, should dishearten his army.

**BATES**  
He may show what outward courage he will; but I  
believe, as cold a night as 'tis, he could wish  
himself in Thames up to the neck; and so I would he  
were, and I by him, at all adventures, so we were quit here.

**KING HENRY V**  
By my troth, I will speak my conscience of the king:  
I think he would not wish himself anywhere but  
where he is.

**BATES**  
Then I would he were here alone; so should he be  
sure to be ransomed, and a many poor men's lives saved.

**KING HENRY V**  
I dare say you love him not so ill, to wish him here  
alone, howsoever you speak this to feel other men's  
minds: methinks I could not die anywhere so  
contented as in the king's company; his cause being  
just and his quarrel honourable.

**WILLIAMS**  
That's more than we know.

**BATES**  
Ay, or more than we should seek after; for we know  
enough, if we know we are the kings subjects: if  
his cause be wrong, our obedience to the king wipes  
the crime of it out of us.

**WILLIAMS**  
But if the cause be not good, the king himself hath  
a heavy reckoning to make, when all those legs and  
arms and heads, chopped off in battle, shall join  
together at the latter day and cry all 'We died at  
such a place;' some swearing, some crying for a  
surgeon, some upon their wives left poor behind  
them, some upon the debts they owe, some upon their  
children rawly left. I am afeard there are few die  
well that die in a battle; for how can they  
charitably dispose of anything, when blood is their  
argument? Now, if these men do not die well, it  
will be a black matter for the king that led them to  
it; whom to disobey were against all proportion of  
subjection.

**KING HENRY V**  
So, if a servant, under his master's command transporting a  
sum of money, be assailed by robbers and die in  
many irreconciled iniquities, you may call the  
business of the master the author of the servant's  
damnation: but this is not so: the king is not  
bound to answer the particular endings of his  
soldiers, nor the master of  
his servant; for they purpose not their death, when  
they purpose their services. Besides, there is no  
king, be his cause never so spotless, if it come to  
the arbitrement of swords, can try it out with all  
unspotted soldiers: some peradventure have on them  
the guilt of premeditated and contrived murder;  
some, making the wars their bulwark, that  
have before gored the gentle bosom of peace with  
pillage and robbery. Now, if these men have  
defeated the law and outrun native punishment,  
though they can outstrip men, they have no wings to  
fly from God: war is his beadle, war is vengeance;  
so that here men are punished for before-breach of  
the king's laws in now the king's quarrel: where  
they feared the death, they have borne life away;  
and where they would be safe, they perish: then if  
they die unprovided, no more is the king guilty of  
their damnation than he was before guilty of those  
impieties for the which they are now visited. Every  
subject's duty is the king's; but every subject's  
soul is his own. Therefore should every soldier in  
the wars do as every sick man in his bed: and dying so, death  
is to him advantage; or not dying, the time was  
blessedly lost wherein such preparation was gained:  
and in him that escapes, it were not sin to think  
that, making God so free an offer, He let him  
outlive that day to see His greatness and to teach  
others how they should prepare.

**WILLIAMS**  
'Tis certain, every man that dies ill, the ill upon  
his own head, the king is not to answer it.

**BATES**  
But I do not desire he should answer for me; and  
yet I determine to fight lustily for him.

**KING HENRY V**  
I myself heard the king say he would not be ransomed.

**WILLIAMS**  
Ay, he said so, to make us fight cheerfully: but  
when our throats are cut, he may be ransomed, and we  
ne'er the wiser.

**KING HENRY V**  
If I live to see it, I will never trust his word after.

**WILLIAMS**  
You pay him then. That's a perilous shot out of an  
elder-gun, that a poor and private displeasure can  
do against a monarch! you may as well go about to  
turn the sun to ice with fanning in his face with a  
peacock's feather. You'll never trust his word  
after! come, 'tis a foolish saying.

**KING HENRY V**  
Your reproof is something too round: I should be  
angry with you, if the time were convenient.

**WILLIAMS**  
Let it be a quarrel between us, if you live.

**KING HENRY V**  
I embrace it.

**WILLIAMS**  
Here's my glove: give me another of thine.

**KING HENRY V**  
There.

**WILLIAMS**  
This will I wear in my cap: if ever thou come  
to me and say, after to-morrow, 'This is my glove,'  
by this hand, I will take thee a box on the ear.

**KING HENRY V**  
If ever I live to see it, I will challenge it.

**WILLIAMS**  
Keep thy word: fare thee well.

**BATES**  
Be friends, you English fools, be friends: we have  
French quarrels enow, if you could tell how to reckon.

**KING HENRY V**  
Indeed, the French may lay twenty French crowns to  
one, they will beat us; for they bear them on their  
shoulders: but it is no English treason to cut  
French crowns, and to-morrow the king himself will  
be a clipper.

*Exeunt soldiers*

Upon the king! let us our lives, our souls,  
Our children and our sins lay on the king!  
We must bear all. O hard condition,  
Twin-born with greatness, subject to the breath  
Of every fool, whose sense no more can feel  
But his own wringing! What infinite heart's-ease  
Must kings neglect, that private men enjoy!  
And what have kings, that privates have not too,  
Save ceremony, save general ceremony?  
What kind of god art thou, that suffer'st more  
Of mortal griefs than do thy worshippers?  
O ceremony, show me but thy worth!  
Art thou aught else but place, degree and form,  
Creating awe and fear in other men?  
Wherein thou art less happy being fear'd  
Than they in fearing.  
What drink'st thou oft, instead of homage sweet,  
But poison'd flattery? O, be sick, great greatness,  
And bid thy ceremony give thee cure!  
Think'st thou the fiery fever will go out  
With titles blown from adulation?  
Canst thou, when thou command'st the beggar's knee,  
Command the health of it? No, thou proud dream,  
That play'st so subtly with a king's repose;  
I am a king that find thee, and I know  
'Tis not the balm, the sceptre and the ball,  
The sword, the mace, the crown imperial,  
The throne he sits on, nor the tide of pomp  
That beats upon the high shore of this world,  
No, not all these, thrice-gorgeous ceremony,  
Can sleep so soundly as the wretched slave,  
Who with a body fill'd and vacant mind  
Gets him to rest, cramm'd with distressful bread;  
And, but for ceremony, such a wretch,  
Winding up days with toil and nights with sleep,  
Had the fore-hand and vantage of a king.  
The slave, a member of the country's peace,  
Enjoys it; but in gross brain little wots  
What watch the king keeps to maintain the peace,  
Whose hours the peasant best advantages.

O God of battles! steel my soldiers' hearts;  
Possess them not with fear; take from them now  
The sense of reckoning, if the opposed numbers  
Pluck their hearts from them. Not to-day, O Lord,  
O, not to-day, think not upon the fault  
My father made in compassing the crown!

*Enter GLOUCESTER*

**GLOUCESTER**  
My liege!

**KING HENRY V**  
My brother Gloucester's voice? Ay;  
I know thy errand, I will go with thee:  
The day, my friends and all things stay for me.

*Exeunt*

### SCENE II. The French camp.

*Enter the DAUPHIN, and ORLEANS*

**ORLEANS**  
The sun doth gild our armour; up, my lord!

**DAUPHIN**  
Montez A cheval! My horse! varlet! laquais! ha!

**ORLEANS**  
O brave spirit!

**DAUPHIN**  
Via! les eaux et la terre.

**ORLEANS**  
Rien puis? L'air et la feu.

**DAUPHIN**  
Ciel, cousin Orleans.

*Enter Constable*

Now, my lord constable!

**Constable**  
Hark, how our steeds for present service neigh!

**DAUPHIN**  
Mount them, and make incision in their hides,  
That their hot blood may spin in English eyes,  
And dout them with superfluous courage, ha!

**ORLEANS**  
What, will you have them weep our horses' blood?  
How shall we, then, behold their natural tears?

*Enter Messenger*

**Messenger**  
The English are embattled, you French peers.

*Exit Messenger*

**Constable**  
To horse, you gallant princes! straight to horse!  
Do but behold yon poor and starved band,  
And your fair show shall suck away their souls,  
Leaving them but the shales and husks of men.  
There is not work enough for all our hands;  
Scarce blood enough in all their sickly veins  
To give each naked curtle-axe a stain,  
That our French gallants shall to-day draw out,  
And sheathe for lack of sport: let us but blow on them,  
The vapour of our valour will o'erturn them.  
'Tis positive 'gainst all exceptions, lords,  
That our superfluous lackeys and our peasants,  
Who in unnecessary action swarm  
About our squares of battle, were enow  
To purge this field of such a hilding foe,  
Though we upon this mountain's basis by  
Took stand for idle speculation:  
But that our honours must not. What's to say?  
A very little little let us do.  
And all is done. Then let the trumpets sound  
The tucket sonance and the note to mount;  
For our approach shall so much dare the field  
That England shall couch down in fear and yield.

*Exeunt*

### SCENE III. The English camp.

*Enter GLOUCESTER and EXETER*

**GLOUCESTER**  
Where is the king?

**EXETER**  
The king himself is rode to view their battle.

**GLOUCESTER**  
Of fighting men they have full three score thousand.

**EXETER**  
There's five to one; besides, they all are fresh.

**GLOUCESTER**  
God's arm strike with us! 'tis a fearful odds.

*Enter the KING*

**EXETER**  
O that we now had here  
But one ten thousand of those men in England  
That do no work to-day!

**KING HENRY V**  
What's he that wishes so?  
If we are mark'd to die, we are e'now  
To do our country loss; and if to live,  
The fewer men, the greater share of honour.  
God's will! I pray thee, wish not one man more.  
By Jove, I am not covetous for gold,  
Nor care I who doth feed upon my cost;  
But if it be a sin to covet honour,  
I am the most offending soul alive.  
No, faith, my coz, wish not a man from England:  
God's peace! I would not lose so great an honour  
As one man more, methinks, would share from me  
For the best hope I have. O, do not wish one more!  
Rather proclaim it, Exeter, through my host,  
That he which hath no stomach to this fight,  
Let him depart; his passport shall be made  
And crowns for convoy put into his purse:  
We would not die in that man's company  
That fears his fellowship to die with us.  
This day is called the feast of Crispian:  
He that shall live this day, and see old age,  
Will yearly on the vigil feast his neighbours,  
And say 'To-morrow is Saint Crispian:'  
Then will he strip his sleeve and show his scars.  
And say 'These wounds I had on Crispin's day.'  
Old men forget: yet all shall be forgot,  
But he'll remember with advantages  
What feats he did that day: then shall our names.  
This story shall the good man teach his son;  
And Crispin Crispian shall ne'er go by,  
From this day to the ending of the world,  
But we in it shall be remember'd;  
We few, we happy few, we band of brothers;  
For he to-day that sheds his blood with me  
Shall be my brother; be he ne'er so vile,  
This day shall gentle his condition:  
And gentlemen in England now a-bed  
Shall think themselves accursed they were not here,  
And hold their manhoods cheap whiles any speaks  
That fought with us upon Saint Crispin's day.

*Enter SALISBURY*

**SALISBURY**  
My sovereign lord, bestow yourself with speed:  
The French are bravely in their battles set,  
And will with all expedience charge on us.

**KING HENRY V**  
All things are ready, if our minds be so.

**EXETER**  
Perish the man whose mind is backward now!

**KING HENRY V**  
Thou dost not wish more help from England, coz?

**EXETER**  
God's will! my liege, would you and I alone,  
Without more help, could fight this royal battle!

**KING HENRY V**  
Why, now thou hast unwish'd five thousand men;  
Which likes me better than to wish us one.  
You know your places: God be with you all!

*Exeunt*

### SCENE IV. The field of battle.

*Alarum. Excursions. Enter PISTOL, French Soldier, and Boy*

**PISTOL**  
Yield, cur!

**French Soldier**  
Je pense que vous etes gentilhomme de bonne qualite.

**PISTOL**  
Qualtitie calmie custure me! Art thou a gentleman?  
what is thy name? discuss.

**French Soldier**  
O Seigneur Dieu!

**PISTOL**  
O, Signieur Dew should be a gentleman:  
Perpend my words, O Signieur Dew, and mark;  
O Signieur Dew, thou diest on point of fox,  
Except, O signieur, thou do give to me  
Egregious ransom.

**French Soldier**  
O, prenez misericorde! ayez pitie de moi!

**PISTOL**  
Moy shall not serve; I will have forty moys;  
Or I will fetch thy rim out at thy throat  
In drops of crimson blood.

**PISTOL**  
Come hither, boy: ask me this slave in French  
What is his name.

**Boy**  
Ecoutez: comment etes-vous appele?

**French Soldier**  
Monsieur le Fer.

**Boy**  
He says his name is Master Fer.

**PISTOL**  
Master Fer! I'll fer him, and firk him, and ferret  
him: discuss the same in French unto him.

**Boy**  
I do not know the French for fer, and ferret, and firk.

**PISTOL**  
Bid him prepare; for I will cut his throat.

**French Soldier**  
Que dit-il, monsieur?

**Boy**  
Il me commande de vous dire que vous faites vous  
pret; car ce soldat ici est dispose tout a cette  
heure de couper votre gorge.

**PISTOL**  
Owy, cuppele gorge, permafoy,  
Peasant, unless thou give me crowns, brave crowns;  
Or mangled shalt thou be by this my sword.

**French Soldier**  
O, je vous supplie, pour l'amour de Dieu, me  
pardonner! Je suis gentilhomme de bonne maison:  
gardez ma vie, et je vous donnerai deux cents ecus.

**PISTOL**  
What are his words?

**Boy**  
He prays you to save his life: he is a gentleman of  
a good house; and for his ransom he will give you  
two hundred crowns.

**PISTOL**  
Tell him my fury shall abate, and I the crowns will take.

**French Soldier**  
Petit monsieur, que dit-il?

**Boy**  
Encore qu'il est contre son jurement de pardonner  
aucun prisonnier, neanmoins, pour les ecus que vous  
l'avez promis, il est content de vous donner la  
liberte, le franchisement.

**French Soldier**  
Sur mes genoux je vous donne mille remercimens; et  
je m'estime heureux que je suis tombe entre les  
mains d'un chevalier, je pense, le plus brave,  
vaillant, et tres distingue seigneur d'Angleterre.

**PISTOL**  
Expound unto me, boy.

**Boy**  
He gives you, upon his knees, a thousand thanks; and  
he esteems himself happy that he hath fallen into  
the hands of one, as he thinks, the most brave,  
valorous, and thrice-worthy signieur of England.

**PISTOL**  
As I suck blood, I will some mercy show.  
Follow me!

**Boy**  
Suivez-vous le grand capitaine.

*Exeunt PISTOL, and French Soldier*

I did never know so full a voice issue from so  
empty a heart: but the saying is true 'The empty  
vessel makes the greatest sound.' Bardolph and Nym  
had ten times more valour than this roaring devil i'  
the old play, that every one may pare his nails with  
a wooden dagger; and they are both hanged; and so  
would this be, if he durst steal anything  
adventurously. I must stay with the lackeys, with  
the luggage of our camp: the French might have a  
good prey of us, if he knew of it; for there is  
none to guard it but boys.

*Exit*

### SCENE V. Another part of the field.

*Enter Constable, ORLEANS, and the DAUPHIN*

**Constable**  
O diable!

**ORLEANS**  
O seigneur! le jour est perdu, tout est perdu!

**DAUPHIN**  
Mort de ma vie! all is confounded, all!  
Reproach and everlasting shame  
Sits mocking in our plumes. O merchante fortune!  
Do not run away.

*A short alarum*

**Constable**  
Why, all our ranks are broke.

**DAUPHIN**  
O perdurable shame! let's stab ourselves.  
Be these the wretches that we play'd at dice for?

**ORLEANS**  
Is this the king we sent to for his ransom?

**Constable**  
Disorder, that hath spoil'd us, friend us now!  
Let us on heaps go offer up our lives.

**ORLEANS**  
We are enow yet living in the field  
To smother up the English in our throngs,  
If any order might be thought upon.

**Constable**  
The devil take order now! I'll to the throng:  
Let life be short; else shame will be too long.

*Exeunt*

### SCENE VI. Another part of the field.

*Alarums. Enter KING HENRY and EXETER*

**KING HENRY V**  
Well have we done, thrice valiant countrymen:  
But all's not done; yet keep the French the field.

**EXETER**  
The Duke of York commends him to your majesty.

**KING HENRY V**  
I saw him down; thrice up again and fighting;  
From helmet to the spur all blood he was.

**EXETER**  
In which array, brave soldier, doth he lie,  
Larding the plain; and by his bloody side,  
Yoke-fellow to his honour-owing wounds,  
The noble Earl of Suffolk also lies.

*Alarum*

**KING HENRY V**  
But, hark! what new alarum is this same?  
The French have reinforced their scatter'd men:  
Then every soldier kill his prisoners:  
Give the word through.

*Exeunt*

### SCENE VII. Another part of the field.

*Enter FLUELLEN and GOWER*

**FLUELLEN**  
Kill the poys and the luggage! 'tis expressly  
against the law of arms: 'tis as arrant a piece of  
knavery, mark you now, as can be offer't; in your  
conscience, now, is it not?

**GOWER**  
'Tis certain there's not a boy left alive; and the  
cowardly rascals that ran from the battle ha' done  
this slaughter: besides, they have burned and  
carried away all that was in the king's tent;  
wherefore the king, most worthily, hath caused every  
soldier to cut his prisoner's throat. O, 'tis a  
gallant king!

**FLUELLEN**  
Ay, he was porn at Monmouth, Captain Gower. What  
call you the town's name where Alexander the Pig was born!

**GOWER**  
Alexander the Great.

**FLUELLEN**  
Why, I pray you, is not pig great? the pig, or the  
great, or the mighty, or the huge, or the  
magnanimous, are all one reckonings, save the phrase  
is a little variations.

**GOWER**  
I think Alexander the Great was born in Macedon; his  
father was called Philip of Macedon, as I take it.

**FLUELLEN**  
I think it is in Macedon where Alexander is porn. I  
tell you, captain, if you look in the maps of the  
'orld, I warrant you sall find, in the comparisons  
between Macedon and Monmouth, that the situations,  
look you, is both alike. There is a river in  
Macedon; and there is also moreover a river at  
Monmouth: it is called Wye at Monmouth; but it is  
out of my prains what is the name of the other  
river; but 'tis all one, 'tis alike as my fingers is  
to my fingers, and there is salmons in both. If you  
mark Alexander's life well, Harry of Monmouth's life  
is come after it indifferent well; for there is  
figures in all things. Alexander, God knows, and  
you know, in his rages, and his furies, and his  
wraths, and his cholers, and his moods, and his  
displeasures, and his indignations, and also being a  
little intoxicates in his prains, did, in his ales and  
his angers, look you, kill his best friend, Cleitus.

**GOWER**  
Our king is not like him in that: he never killed  
any of his friends.

**FLUELLEN**  
It is not well done, mark you now take the tales out  
of my mouth, ere it is made and finished. I speak  
but in the figures and comparisons of it: as  
Alexander killed his friend Cleitus, being in his  
ales and his cups; so also Harry Monmouth, being in  
his right wits and his good judgments, turned away  
the fat knight with the great belly-doublet: he  
was full of jests, and gipes, and knaveries, and  
mocks; I have forgot his name.

**GOWER**  
Sir John Falstaff.

**FLUELLEN**  
That is he: I'll tell you there is good men porn at Monmouth.

**GOWER**  
Here comes his majesty.

*Alarum. Enter KING HENRY with GLOUCESTER*

*Exit GOWER*

**KING HENRY V**  
I was not angry since I came to France  
Until this instant. Take a trumpet, herald;  
Ride thou unto the horsemen on yon hill:  
If they will fight with us, bid them come down,  
Or void the field; they do offend our sight:  
If they'll do neither, we will come to them,  
And make them skirr away, as swift as stones  
Enforced from the old Assyrian slings:  
Besides, we'll cut the throats of those we have,  
And not a man of them that we shall take  
Shall taste our mercy. Go and tell them so.

*Enter MONTJOY*

**GLOUCESTER**  
Here comes the herald of the French, my liege.  
His eyes are humbler than they used to be.

**KING HENRY V**  
How now! what means this, herald? know'st thou not  
That I have fined these bones of mine for ransom?  
Comest thou again for ransom?

**MONTJOY**  
No, great king:  
I come to thee for charitable licence,  
That we may wander o'er this bloody field  
To look our dead, and then to bury them;  
To sort our nobles from our common men.  
For many of our princes--woe the while!--  
Lie drown'd and soak'd in mercenary blood;  
So do our vulgar drench their peasant limbs  
In blood of princes; and their wounded steeds  
Fret fetlock deep in gore and with wild rage  
Yerk out their armed heels at their dead masters,  
Killing them twice. O, give us leave, great king,  
To view the field in safety and dispose  
Of their dead bodies! The day is yours.

**KING HENRY V**  
Praised be God, and not our strength, for it!  
What is this castle call'd that stands hard by?

**MONTJOY**  
They call it Agincourt.

**KING HENRY V**  
Then call we this the field of Agincourt,  
Fought on the day of Crispin Crispianus.  
God keep it so! Our heralds go with him:  
Bring me just notice of the numbers dead  
On both our parts. Call yonder fellow hither.

*Points to WILLIAMS. Exeunt Montjoy*

**GLOUCESTER**  
Soldier, you must come to the king.

**KING HENRY V**  
Soldier, why wearest thou that glove in thy cap?

**WILLIAMS**  
An't please your majesty, 'tis the gage of one that  
I should fight withal, if he be alive.

**KING HENRY V**  
An Englishman?

**WILLIAMS**  
An't please your majesty, a rascal that swaggered  
with me last night; who, if alive and ever dare to  
challenge this glove, I have sworn to take him a box  
o' th' ear: or if I can see my glove in his cap,  
which he swore, as he was a soldier, he would wear  
if alive, I will strike it out soundly.

**KING HENRY V**  
What think you, Captain Fluellen? is it fit this  
soldier keep his oath?

**FLUELLEN**  
He is a craven and a villain else, an't please your  
majesty, in my conscience.

**KING HENRY V**  
It may be his enemy is a gentleman of great sort,  
quite from the answer of his degree.

**FLUELLEN**  
Though he be as good a gentleman as the devil is, as  
Lucifer and Belzebub himself, it is necessary, look  
your grace, that he keep his vow and his oath: if  
he be perjured, see you now, his reputation is as  
arrant a villain and a Jacksauce, as ever his black  
shoe trod upon God's ground and his earth, in my  
conscience, la!

**KING HENRY V**  
Then keep thy vow, sirrah, when thou meetest the fellow.

**WILLIAMS**  
So I will, my liege, as I live.

**KING HENRY V**  
Who servest thou under?

**WILLIAMS**  
Under Captain Gower, my liege.

**FLUELLEN**  
Gower is a good captain, and is good knowledge and  
literatured in the wars.

**KING HENRY V**  
Call him hither to me, soldier.

**WILLIAMS**  
I will, my liege.

*Exit*

**KING HENRY V**  
Knowest thou Gower?

**FLUELLEN**  
He is my dear friend, an please you.

**KING HENRY V**  
Pray thee, go seek him, and bring him to my tent.

**FLUELLEN**  
I will fetch him.

*Exit*

**KING HENRY V**  
My good brother Gloucester,  
Follow Fluellen closely at the heels:  
The glove which I have given him for a favour  
May haply purchase him a box o' th' ear;  
It is the soldier's; I by bargain should  
Wear it myself. Follow, good brother Gloucester:  
If that the soldier strike him, as I judge  
By his blunt bearing he will keep his word,  
Some sudden mischief may arise of it;  
For I do know Fluellen valiant  
And quickly will return an injury:  
Follow and see there be no harm between them.

*Exeunt*

### SCENE VIII. Before KING HENRY'S pavilion.

*Enter GOWER and WILLIAMS*

**WILLIAMS**  
I warrant it is to knight you, captain.

*Enter FLUELLEN*

**FLUELLEN**  
God's will and his pleasure, captain, I beseech you  
now, come apace to the king: there is more good  
toward you peradventure than is in your knowledge to dream of.

**WILLIAMS**  
Sir, know you this glove?

**FLUELLEN**  
Know the glove! I know the glove is glove.

**WILLIAMS**  
I know this; and thus I challenge it.  
*\[Strikes him]*

**FLUELLEN**  
'Sblood! an arrant traitor as any is in the  
universal world, or in France, or in England!

**GOWER**  
How now, sir! you villain!

**WILLIAMS**  
Do you think I'll be forsworn?

**FLUELLEN**  
Stand away, Captain Gower; I will give treason his  
payment into ploughs, I warrant you.

**WILLIAMS**  
I am no traitor.

**FLUELLEN**  
That's a lie in thy throat. I charge you in his  
majesty's name, apprehend him: he's a friend of the  
Duke Alencon's.

*Enter GLOUCESTER*

**GLOUCESTER**  
How now, how now! what's the matter?

**FLUELLEN**  
My Lord of Gloucester, here is--praised be God for it!  
--a most contagious treason come to light, look  
you, as you shall desire in a summer's day. Here is  
his majesty.

*Enter KING HENRY*

My liege, here is a villain and a traitor, that,  
look your grace, has struck the glove which your  
majesty is take out of the helmet of Alencon.

**WILLIAMS**  
My liege, this was my glove; here is the fellow of  
it; and he that I gave it to in change promised to  
wear it in his cap: I promised to strike him, if he  
did: I met this man with my glove in his cap, and I  
have been as good as my word.

**FLUELLEN**  
Your majesty hear now, saving your majesty's  
manhood, what an arrant, rascally, beggarly, lousy  
knave it is: I hope your majesty is pear me  
testimony and witness, and will avouchment, that  
this is the glove of Alencon, that your majesty is  
give me; in your conscience, now?

**KING HENRY V**  
Give me thy glove, soldier: look, here is the  
fellow of it.  
'Twas I, indeed, thou promised'st to strike;  
And thou hast given me most bitter terms.

**FLUELLEN**  
An please your majesty, let his neck answer for it,  
if there is any martial law in the world.

**WILLIAMS**  
Your majesty came not like yourself: you appeared to  
me but as a common man; witness the night, your  
garments, your lowliness; and what your highness  
suffered under that shape, I beseech you take it for  
your own fault and not mine: for had you been as I  
took you for, I made no offence; therefore, I  
beseech your highness, pardon me.

**KING HENRY V**  
Here, brother Gloucester, fill this glove with crowns,  
And give it to this fellow. Keep it, fellow;  
And wear it for an honour in thy cap  
Till I do challenge it. Give him the crowns:  
And, captain, you must needs be friends with him.

**FLUELLEN**  
By this day and this light, the fellow has mettle  
enough in his belly. Hold, there is twelve pence  
for you; and I pray you to serve Got, and keep you  
out of prawls, and prabbles' and quarrels, and  
dissensions, and, I warrant you, it is the better for you.

**WILLIAMS**  
I will none of your money.

**FLUELLEN**  
It is with a good will; I can tell you, it will  
serve you to mend your shoes: come, wherefore should  
you be so pashful? your shoes is not so good: 'tis  
a good silling, I warrant you, or I will change it.

*Enter an English Herald*

**KING HENRY V**  
Now, herald, are the dead number'd?

**Herald**  
Here is the number of the slaughter'd French.

**KING HENRY V**  
What prisoners of good sort are taken, brother?

**GLOUCESTER**  
Charles Duke of Orleans, nephew to the king;  
John Duke of Bourbon, and Lord Bouciqualt:  
Of other lords and barons, knights and squires,  
Full fifteen hundred, besides common men.

**KING HENRY V**  
This note doth tell me of ten thousand French  
That in the field lie slain: of princes, in this number,  
And nobles bearing banners, there lie dead  
One hundred twenty six: added to these,  
Of knights, esquires, and gallant gentlemen,  
Eight thousand and four hundred; of the which,  
Five hundred were but yesterday dubb'd knights:  
So that, in these ten thousand they have lost,  
There are but sixteen hundred mercenaries;  
The rest are princes, barons, lords, knights, squires,  
And gentlemen of blood and quality.  
Where is the number of our English dead?

*Herald shews him another paper*

Edward the Duke of York, the Earl of Suffolk,  
Sir Richard Ketly, Davy Gam, esquire:  
None else of name; and of all other men  
But five and twenty. O God, thy arm was here;  
And not to us, but to thy arm alone,  
Ascribe we all! When, without stratagem,  
But in plain shock and even play of battle,  
Was ever known so great and little loss  
On one part and on the other? Take it, God,  
For it is none but thine!

**GLOUCESTER**  
'Tis wonderful!

**KING HENRY V**  
Come, go we in procession to the village.  
And be it death proclaimed through our host  
To boast of this or take the praise from God  
Which is his only.

The dead with charity enclosed in clay:  
And then to Calais; and to England then:  
Where ne'er from France arrived more happy men.

*Exeunt*

## ACT V

### PROLOGUE

*Enter Chorus*

**Chorus**  
Vouchsafe to those that have not read the story,  
That I may prompt them: and of such as have,  
I humbly pray them to admit the excuse  
Of time, of numbers and due course of things,  
Which cannot in their huge and proper life  
Be here presented. Now we bear the king  
Toward Calais: grant him there; there seen,  
Heave him away upon your winged thoughts  
Athwart the sea. Behold, the English beach  
Pales in the flood with men, with wives and boys,  
Whose shouts and claps out-voice the deep mouth'd sea,  
Which like a mighty whiffler 'fore the king  
Seems to prepare his way: so let him land,  
And solemnly see him set on to London.  
So swift a pace hath thought that even now  
You may imagine him upon Blackheath;  
Where that his lords desire him to have borne  
His bruised helmet and his bended sword  
Before him through the city: he forbids it,  
Being free from vainness and self-glorious pride;  
Giving full trophy, signal and ostent  
Quite from himself to God. But now behold,  
In the quick forge and working-house of thought,  
How London doth pour out her citizens!  
The mayor and all his brethren in best sort,  
Like to the senators of the antique Rome,  
With the plebeians swarming at their heels,  
Go forth and fetch their conquering Caesar in:  
As, by a lower but loving likelihood,  
Were now the general of our gracious empress,  
As in good time he may, from Ireland coming,  
Bringing rebellion broached on his sword,  
How many would the peaceful city quit,  
To welcome him! much more, and much more cause,  
Did they this Harry. Now in London place him;  
As yet the lamentation of the French  
Invites the King of England's stay at home;  
The emperor's coming in behalf of France,  
To order peace between them; and omit  
All the occurrences, whatever chanced,  
Till Harry's back-return again to France:  
There must we bring him; and myself have play'd  
The interim, by remembering you 'tis past.  
Then brook abridgment, and your eyes advance,  
After your thoughts, straight back again to France.

*Exit*

### SCENE I. France. The English camp.

*Enter FLUELLEN and GOWER*

**GOWER**  
Nay, that's right; but why wear you your leek today?  
Saint Davy's day is past.

**FLUELLEN**  
There is occasions and causes why and wherefore in  
all things: I will tell you, asse my friend,  
Captain Gower: the rascally, scald, beggarly,  
lousy, pragging knave, Pistol, which you and  
yourself and all the world know to be no petter  
than a fellow, look you now, of no merits, he is  
come to me and prings me pread and salt yesterday,  
look you, and bid me eat my leek: it was in place  
where I could not breed no contention with him; but  
I will be so bold as to wear it in my cap till I see  
him once again, and then I will tell him a little  
piece of my desires.

*Enter PISTOL*

**GOWER**  
Why, here he comes, swelling like a turkey-cock.

**FLUELLEN**  
'Tis no matter for his swellings nor his  
turkey-cocks. God pless you, Aunchient Pistol! you  
scurvy, lousy knave, God pless you!

**PISTOL**  
Ha! art thou bedlam? dost thou thirst, base Trojan,  
To have me fold up Parca's fatal web?  
Hence! I am qualmish at the smell of leek.

**FLUELLEN**  
I peseech you heartily, scurvy, lousy knave, at my  
desires, and my requests, and my petitions, to eat,  
look you, this leek: because, look you, you do not  
love it, nor your affections and your appetites and  
your digestions doo's not agree with it, I would  
desire you to eat it.

**PISTOL**  
Not for Cadwallader and all his goats.

**FLUELLEN**  
There is one goat for you.

*Strikes him*

Will you be so good, scauld knave, as eat it?

**PISTOL**  
Base Trojan, thou shalt die.

**FLUELLEN**  
You say very true, scauld knave, when God's will is:  
I will desire you to live in the meantime, and eat  
your victuals: come, there is sauce for it.

*Strikes him*

You called me yesterday mountain-squire; but I will  
make you to-day a squire of low degree. I pray you,  
fall to: if you can mock a leek, you can eat a leek.

**GOWER**  
Enough, captain: you have astonished him.

**FLUELLEN**  
I say, I will make him eat some part of my leek, or  
I will peat his pate four days. Bite, I pray you; it  
is good for your green wound and your ploody coxcomb.

**PISTOL**  
Must I bite?

**FLUELLEN**  
Yes, certainly, and out of doubt and out of question  
too, and ambiguities.

**PISTOL**  
By this leek, I will most horribly revenge: I eat  
and eat, I swear--

**FLUELLEN**  
Eat, I pray you: will you have some more sauce to  
your leek? there is not enough leek to swear by.

**PISTOL**  
Quiet thy cudgel; thou dost see I eat.

**FLUELLEN**  
Much good do you, scauld knave, heartily. Nay, pray  
you, throw none away; the skin is good for your  
broken coxcomb. When you take occasions to see leeks  
hereafter, I pray you, mock at 'em; that is all.

**PISTOL**  
Good.

**FLUELLEN**  
Ay, leeks is good: hold you, there is a groat to  
heal your pate.

**PISTOL**  
Me a groat!

**FLUELLEN**  
Yes, verily and in truth, you shall take it; or I  
have another leek in my pocket, which you shall eat.

**PISTOL**  
I take thy groat in earnest of revenge.

**FLUELLEN**  
If I owe you anything, I will pay you in cudgels:  
you shall be a woodmonger, and buy nothing of me but  
cudgels. God b' wi' you, and keep you, and heal your pate.

*Exit*

**PISTOL**  
All hell shall stir for this.

**GOWER**  
Go, go; you are a counterfeit cowardly knave. Will  
you mock at an ancient tradition, begun upon an  
honourable respect, and worn as a memorable trophy of  
predeceased valour and dare not avouch in your deeds  
any of your words? I have seen you gleeking and  
galling at this gentleman twice or thrice. You  
thought, because he could not speak English in the  
native garb, he could not therefore handle an  
English cudgel: you find it otherwise; and  
henceforth let a Welsh correction teach you a good  
English condition. Fare ye well.

*Exit*

**PISTOL**  
Doth Fortune play the huswife with me now?  
News have I, that my Nell is dead i' the spital  
Of malady of France;  
And there my rendezvous is quite cut off.  
Old I do wax; and from my weary limbs  
Honour is cudgelled. Well, bawd I'll turn,  
And something lean to cutpurse of quick hand.  
To England will I steal, and there I'll steal:  
And patches will I get unto these cudgell'd scars,  
And swear I got them in the Gallia wars.

*Exit*

### SCENE II. France. A royal palace.

*Enter, at one door KING HENRY, EXETER, and GLOUCESTER; at another, the
FRENCH KING, QUEEN ISABEL, the PRINCESS KATHARINE, ALICE, and the DUKE
of BURGUNDY*

**KING HENRY V**  
Peace to this meeting, wherefore we are met!  
Unto our brother France, and to our sister,  
Health and fair time of day; joy and good wishes  
To our most fair and princely cousin Katharine;  
We do salute you, Duke of Burgundy;  
And, princes French, and peers, health to you all!

**KING OF FRANCE**  
Right joyous are we to behold your face,  
Most worthy brother England; fairly met:  
So are you, princes English, everyone.

**QUEEN ISABEL**  
So happy be the issue, brother England,  
Of this good day and of this gracious meeting,  
As we are now glad to behold your eyes;  
Your eyes, which hitherto have borne in them  
Against the French, that met them in their bent,  
The fatal balls of murdering basilisks:  
The venom of such looks, we fairly hope,  
Have lost their quality, and that this day  
Shall change all griefs and quarrels into love.

**BURGUNDY**  
My duty to you both, on equal love,  
Great Kings of France and England! That I have labour'd,  
With all my wits, my pains and strong endeavours,  
To bring your most imperial majesties  
Unto this bar and royal interview,  
Your mightiness on both parts best can witness.  
Since then my office hath so far prevail'd  
That, face to face and royal eye to eye,  
You have congreeted, let it not disgrace me,  
If I demand, before this royal view,  
What rub or what impediment there is,  
Why that the naked, poor and mangled Peace,  
Dear nurse of arts and joyful births,  
Should not in this best garden of the world  
Our fertile France, put up her lovely visage?  
Alas, she hath from France too long been chased,  
And all her husbandry doth lie on heaps,  
Corrupting in its own fertility.  
You are assembled: and my speech entreats  
That I may know the let, why gentle Peace  
Should not expel these inconveniences  
And bless us with her former qualities.

**KING HENRY V**  
If, Duke of Burgundy, you would the peace,  
Whose want gives growth to the imperfections  
Which you have cited, you must buy that peace  
With full accord to all our just demands;  
Whose tenors and particular effects  
You have enscheduled briefly in your hands.

**BURGUNDY**  
The king hath heard them; to the which as yet  
There is no answer made.

**KING OF FRANCE**  
I have but with a cursorary eye  
O'erglanced the articles: pleaseth your grace  
To appoint some of your council presently  
To sit with us once more, with better heed  
To re-survey them, we will suddenly  
Pass our accept and peremptory answer.

**KING HENRY V**  
Brother, we shall. Go, uncle Exeter,  
And you, brother Gloucester, go with the king;  
And take with you free power to ratify,  
Augment, or alter, as your wisdoms best  
Shall see advantageable for our dignity,  
Anything in or out of our demands,  
And we'll consign thereto. Will you, fair sister,  
Go with the princes, or stay here with us?

**QUEEN ISABEL**  
Our gracious brother, I will go with them:  
Haply a woman's voice may do some good,  
When articles too nicely urged be stood on.

**KING HENRY V**  
Yet leave our cousin Katharine here with us:  
She is our capital demand, comprised  
Within the fore-rank of our articles.

**QUEEN ISABEL**  
She hath good leave.

*Exeunt all except HENRY, KATHARINE, and ALICE*

**KING HENRY V**  
Fair Katharine, and most fair,  
Will you vouchsafe to teach a soldier terms  
Such as will enter at a lady's ear  
And plead his love-suit to her gentle heart?

**KATHARINE**  
Your majesty shall mock at me; I cannot speak your England.

**KING HENRY V**  
O fair Katharine, if you will love me soundly with  
your French heart, I will be glad to hear you  
confess it brokenly with your English tongue. Do  
you like me, Kate?

**KATHARINE**  
Pardonnez-moi, I cannot tell vat is 'like me.'

**KING HENRY V**  
An angel is like you, Kate, and you are like an angel.

**KATHARINE**  
Que dit-il? que je suis semblable a les anges?

**ALICE**  
Oui, vraiment, sauf votre grace, ainsi dit-il.

**KING HENRY V**  
I said so, dear Katharine; and I must not blush to  
affirm it.

**KATHARINE**  
O bon Dieu! les langues des hommes sont pleines de  
tromperies.

**KING HENRY V**  
What says she, fair one? that the tongues of men  
are full of deceits?

**ALICE**  
Oui, dat de tongues of de mans is be full of  
deceits: dat is de princess.

**KING HENRY V**  
The princess is the better Englishwoman. I' faith,  
Kate, my wooing is fit for thy understanding: I am  
glad thou canst speak no better English; for, if  
thou couldst, thou wouldst find me such a plain king  
that thou wouldst think I had sold my farm to buy my  
crown. I know no ways to mince it in love, but  
directly to say 'I love you:' then if you urge me  
farther than to say 'do you in faith?' I wear out  
my suit. Give me your answer; i' faith, do: and so  
clap hands and a bargain: how say you, lady?

**KATHARINE**  
Sauf votre honneur, me understand vell.

**KING HENRY V**  
Marry, if you would put me to verses or to dance for  
your sake, Kate, why you undid me: for the one, I  
have neither words nor measure, and for the other, I  
have no strength in measure, yet a reasonable  
measure in strength.  
I speak to thee plain soldier: If thou canst  
love me for this, take me: if not, to say to thee  
that I shall die, is true; but for thy love, by the  
Lord, no; yet I love thee too. And while thou  
livest, dear Kate, take a fellow of plain and  
uncoined constancy; for he perforce must do thee  
right. If thou would have such a one, take  
me; and take me, take a soldier; take a soldier,  
take a king. And what sayest thou then to my love?  
speak, my fair, and fairly, I pray thee.

**KATHARINE**  
Is it possible dat I sould love de enemy of France?

**KING HENRY V**  
No; it is not possible you should love the enemy of  
France, Kate: but, in loving me, you should love  
the friend of France; for I love France so well that  
I will not part with a village of it; I will have it  
all mine: and, Kate, when France is mine and I am  
yours, then yours is France and you are mine.

**KATHARINE**  
I cannot tell vat is dat.

**KING HENRY V**  
No, Kate? I will tell thee in French; which I am  
sure will hang upon my tongue like a new-married  
wife about her husband's neck, hardly to be shook  
off. Je quand sur le possession de France, et quand  
vous avez le possession de moi, --donc votre est  
France et vous etes mienne. It is as easy for me,  
Kate, to conquer the kingdom as to speak so much  
more French: I shall never move thee in French,  
unless it be to laugh at me.

**KATHARINE**  
Sauf votre honneur, le Francois que vous parlez, il  
est meilleur que l'Anglois lequel je parle.

**KING HENRY V**  
No, faith, is't not, Kate: but thy speaking of my  
tongue, and I thine, most truly-falsely, must needs  
be granted to be much at one. But, Kate, dost thou  
understand thus much English, canst thou love me?

**KATHARINE**  
I cannot tell.

**KING HENRY V**  
Can any of your neighbours tell, Kate? I'll ask  
them. Come, I know thou lovest me: and at night,  
when you come into your closet, you'll question this  
gentlewoman about me; but, good Kate, mock me mercifully; the  
rather, gentle princess, because I love thee  
cruelly. If ever thou beest mine, Kate, as I have a  
saving faith within me tells me thou shalt, I get  
thee with scambling, and thou must therefore needs  
prove a good soldier-breeder: shall not thou and I,  
between Saint Denis and Saint George, compound a  
boy, half French, half English, that shall go to  
Constantinople and take the Turk by the beard?

**KATHARINE**  
I do not know dat

**KING HENRY V**  
No; 'tis hereafter to know, but now to promise: do  
but now promise, Kate, you will endeavour for your  
French part of such a boy; How answer  
you, la plus belle Katharine du monde, mon tres cher  
et devin deesse?

**KATHARINE**  
Your majestee ave fausse French enough to deceive de  
most sage demoiselle dat is en France.

**KING HENRY V**  
Now, fie upon my false French! By mine honour, in  
true English, I love thee, Kate: by which honour I  
dare not swear thou lovest me; yet my blood begins to  
flatter me that thou dost:  
and therefore tell me, most fair Katharine, will you  
have me? Put off your maiden blushes;  
take me by the hand, and say 'Harry of England I am  
thine:' which word thou shalt no sooner bless mine  
ear withal, but I will tell thee aloud 'England is  
thine, Ireland is thine, France is thine, and Harry  
Plantagenet is thine;' Come, your answer in broken music; for thy voice
is  
music and thy English broken; therefore, queen of  
all, Katharine, break thy mind to me in broken  
English; wilt thou have me?

**KATHARINE**  
Dat is as it sall please de roi mon pere.

**KATHARINE**  
Den it sall also content me.

**KING HENRY V**  
Upon that I kiss your hand, and I call you my queen.

**KATHARINE**  
Laissez, mon seigneur, laissez, laissez: ma foi, je  
ne veux point que vous abaissiez votre grandeur en  
baisant la main d'une de votre seigeurie indigne  
serviteur; excusez-moi, je vous supplie, mon  
tres-puissant seigneur.

**KING HENRY V**  
Then I will kiss your lips, Kate.

**KATHARINE**  
Les dames et demoiselles pour etre baisees devant  
leur noces, il n'est pas la coutume de France.

**KING HENRY V**  
Madam my interpreter, what says she?

**ALICE**  
Dat it is not be de fashion pour les ladies of  
France,--I cannot tell vat is baiser en Anglish.

**KING HENRY V**  
To kiss.

**ALICE**  
Your majesty entendre bettre que moi.

**KING HENRY V**  
It is not a fashion for the maids in France to kiss  
before they are married, would she say?

**ALICE**  
Oui, vraiment.

**KING HENRY V**  
O Kate, nice customs curtsy to great kings. Dear  
Kate, you and I cannot be confined within the weak  
list of a country's fashion: we are the makers of  
manners, Kate; and the liberty that follows our  
places stops the mouth of all find-faults; as I will  
do yours, for upholding the nice fashion of your  
country in denying me a kiss: therefore, patiently  
and yielding.

*Kissing her*

You have witchcraft in your lips, Kate: there is  
more eloquence in a sugar touch of them than in the  
tongues of the French council; and they should  
sooner persuade Harry of England than a general  
petition of monarchs. Here comes your father.

*Re-enter the FRENCH KING and his QUEEN, BURGUNDY, and other Lords*

*Exit Alice*

**BURGUNDY**  
God save your majesty! my royal cousin, teach you  
our princess English?

**KING HENRY V**  
I would have her learn, my fair cousin, how  
perfectly I love her; and that is good English.

**BURGUNDY**  
Is she not apt?

**KING HENRY V**  
Our tongue is rough, coz, and my condition is not  
smooth; so that, having neither the voice nor the  
heart of flattery about me, I cannot so conjure up  
the spirit of love in her, that he will appear in  
his true likeness.

**BURGUNDY**  
Pardon the frankness of my mirth, if I answer you  
for that. If you would conjure in her, you must  
make a circle; if conjure up love in her in his true  
likeness, he must appear naked and blind. Can you  
blame her then, being a maid yet rosed over with the  
virgin crimson of modesty, if she deny the  
appearance of a naked blind boy in her naked seeing  
self? It were, my lord, a hard condition for a maid  
to consign to.

**KING HENRY V**  
Yet they do wink and yield, as love is blind and enforces.

**BURGUNDY**  
They are then excused, my lord, when they see not  
what they do.

**KING HENRY V**  
Then, good my lord, teach your cousin to consent winking.

**BURGUNDY**  
I will wink on her to consent, my lord, if you will  
teach her to know my meaning: for maids, well  
summered and warm kept, are like flies at  
Bartholomew-tide, blind, though they have their  
eyes; and then they will endure handling, which  
before would not abide looking on.

**KING HENRY V**  
It is so: and you may, some of you, thank love for  
my blindness, who cannot see many a fair French city  
for one fair French maid that stands in my way.

**FRENCH KING**  
Yes, my lord, you see them perspectively, the cities  
turned into a maid; for they are all girdled with  
maiden walls that war hath never entered.

**KING HENRY V**  
Shall Kate be my wife?

**FRENCH KING**  
So please you.

**KING HENRY V**  
I am content; so the maiden cities you talk of may  
wait on her: so the maid that stood in the way for  
my wish shall show me the way to my will.

**FRENCH KING**  
We have consented to all terms of reason.

**WESTMORELAND**  
The king hath granted every article:  
His daughter first, and then in sequel all,  
According to their firm proposed natures.

**EXETER**  
Only he hath not yet subscribed this:  
Where your majesty demands, that the King of France,  
having any occasion to write for matter of grant,  
shall name your highness in this form and with this  
addition in French, Notre trescher fils Henri, Roi  
d'Angleterre, Heritier de France; and thus in  
Latin, Praeclarissimus filius noster Henricus, Rex  
Angliae, et Haeres Franciae.

**FRENCH KING**  
Nor this I have not, brother, so denied,  
But your request shall make me let it pass.

**KING HENRY V**  
I pray you then, in love and dear alliance,  
Let that one article rank with the rest;  
And thereupon give me your daughter.

**FRENCH KING**  
Take her, fair son, and from her blood raise up  
Issue to me; that the contending kingdoms  
Of France and England, whose very shores look pale  
With envy of each other's happiness,  
May cease their hatred, and this dear conjunction  
Plant neighbourhood and Christian-like accord  
In their sweet bosoms, that never war advance  
His bleeding sword 'twixt England and fair France.

**ALL**  
Amen!

**KING HENRY V**  
Now, welcome, Kate: and bear me witness all,  
That here I kiss her as my sovereign queen.

*Flourish*

**QUEEN ISABEL**  
God, the best maker of all marriages,  
Combine your hearts in one, your realms in one!  
As man and wife, being two, are one in love,  
So be there 'twixt your kingdoms such a spousal,  
That never may ill office, or fell jealousy,  
Which troubles oft the bed of blessed marriage,  
Thrust in between the paction of these kingdoms,  
To make divorce of their incorporate league;  
That English may as French, French Englishmen,  
Receive each other. God speak this Amen!

**ALL**  
Amen!

*Sennet. Exeunt*

## EPILOGUE

*Enter Chorus*

**Chorus**  
Thus far, with rough and all-unable pen,  
Our bending author hath pursued the story,  
In little room confining mighty men,  
Mangling by starts the full course of their glory.  
Small time, but in that small most greatly lived  
This star of England: Fortune made his sword;  
By which the world's best garden be achieved,  
And of it left his son imperial lord.  
Henry the Sixth, in infant bands crown'd King  
Of France and England, did this king succeed;  
Whose state so many had the managing,  
That they lost France and made his England bleed:  
Which oft our stage hath shown; and, for their sake,  
In your fair minds let this acceptance take.

*Exit*

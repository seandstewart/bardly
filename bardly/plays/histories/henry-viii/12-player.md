# Henry VIII - 12 Players

## ACT I

### SCENE I. London. An ante-chamber in the palace.

*Enter NORFOLK at one door; at the other, BUCKINGHAM*

**BUCKINGHAM**  
Good morrow, and well met. How have ye done  
Since last we saw in France? /

**NORFOLK**  
/ I thank your grace,  
Healthful; and ever since a fresh admirer  
Of what I saw there. /

**BUCKINGHAM**  
/ An untimely ague  
Stay'd me a prisoner in my chamber when  
Those suns of glory, those two lights of men,  
Met in the vale of Andren. /

**NORFOLK**  
/ 'Twixt Guynes and Arde:  
I was then present, saw them salute on horseback;  
Beheld them, when they lighted, how they clung  
In their embracement, as they grew together;  
Which had they, what four throned ones could have weigh'd  
Such a compounded one? /

**BUCKINGHAM**  
/ All the whole time  
I was my chamber's prisoner. /

**NORFOLK**  
/ Then you lost  
The view of earthly glory: men might say,  
Till this time pomp was single, but now married  
To one above itself. Each of these two kings,  
Equal in lustre, were now best, now worst,  
As presence did present them; him in eye,  
Still him in praise: and, being present both  
'Twas said they saw but one; and no discerner  
Durst wag his tongue in censure. When these suns--  
For so they phrase 'em--by their heralds challenged  
The noble spirits to arms, they did perform  
Beyond thought's compass; that former fabulous story,  
Being now seen possible enough, got credit,  
That Bevis was believed. /

**BUCKINGHAM**  
/ O, you go far.

**NORFOLK**  
As I belong to worship and affect  
In honour honesty, the tract of everything  
Would by a good discourser lose some life,  
Which action's self was tongue to. All was royal;  
To the disposing of it nought rebell'd.  
Order gave each thing view; the office did  
Distinctly his full function. /

**BUCKINGHAM**  
/ Who did guide,  
I mean, who set the body and the limbs  
Of this great sport together, as you guess?

**NORFOLK**  
One, certes, that promises no element  
In such a business. /

**BUCKINGHAM**  
/ I pray you, who, my lord?

**NORFOLK**  
All this was order'd by the good discretion  
Of the right reverend Cardinal of York.

**BUCKINGHAM**  
The devil speed him! no man's pie is freed  
From his ambitious finger. What had he  
To do in these fierce vanities? I wonder  
That such a keech can with his very bulk  
Take up the rays o' the beneficial sun  
And keep it from the earth. /

**NORFOLK**  
/ Surely, sir,  
There's in him stuff that puts him to these ends;  
For, being not propp'd by ancestry, whose grace  
Chalks successors their way, nor call'd upon  
For high feats done to the crown; neither allied  
For eminent assistants; but, spider-like,  
Out of his self-drawing web, he gives us note,  
The force of his own merit makes his way  
A gift that heaven gives for him, which buys  
A place next to the king. /

**BUCKINGHAM**  
/ I cannot tell  
What heaven hath given him,--let some graver eye  
Pierce into that; but I can see his pride  
Peep through each part of him: whence has he that,  
If not from hell? the devil is a niggard,  
Or has given all before, and he begins  
A new hell in himself. I do know  
Kinsmen of mine, three at the least, that have  
By this so sickened their estates, that never  
They shall abound as formerly. O, many  
Have broke their backs with laying manors on 'em  
For this great journey. What did this vanity  
But minister communication of  
A most poor issue? /

**NORFOLK**  
/ Grievingly I think,  
The peace between the French and us not values  
The cost that did conclude it. Every man,  
After the hideous storm that follow'd, was  
A thing inspired; and, not consulting, broke  
Into a general prophecy; ha't this tempest,  
Dashing the garment of this peace, aboded  
The sudden breach on't. Which is budded out;  
For France hath flaw'd the league, and hath attach'd  
Our merchants' goods at Bourdeaux. /

**BUCKINGHAM**  
/ Is it therefore  
The ambassador is silenced? /

**NORFOLK**  
/ Marry, is't.

**BUCKINGHAM**  
A proper title of a peace; and purchased  
At a superfluous rate! Why, all this business  
Our reverend cardinal carried. /

**NORFOLK**  
/ Like it your grace,  
The state takes notice of the private difference  
Betwixt you and the cardinal. I advise you--  
And take it from a heart that wishes towards you  
Honour and plenteous safety--that you read  
The cardinal's malice and his potency  
Together; to consider further that  
What his high hatred would effect wants not  
A minister in his power. You know his nature,  
That he's revengeful, and I know his sword  
Hath a sharp edge: it's long and, 't may be said,  
It reaches far, and where 'twill not extend,  
Thither he darts it. Bosom up my counsel,  
You'll find it wholesome. Lo, where comes that rock  
That I advise your shunning.

*Enter CARDINAL WOLSEY, the purse borne before him, and
his Secretary, GARDINER with papers. CARDINAL WOLSEY in
his passage fixeth his eye on BUCKINGHAM, and BUCKINGHAM
on him, both full of disdain*

**CARDINAL WOLSEY**  
The Duke of Buckingham's surveyor, ha?  
Where's his examination? /

**GARDINER**  
/ Here, so please you.

**CARDINAL WOLSEY**  
Is he in person ready? /

**GARDINER**  
/ Ay, please your grace.

**CARDINAL WOLSEY**  
Well, we shall then know more; and Buckingham  
Shall lessen this big look.

*Exeunt CARDINAL WOLSEY and GARDINER*

**BUCKINGHAM**  
This butcher's cur is venom-mouth'd, and I  
Have not the power to muzzle him; therefore best  
Not wake him in his slumber. A beggar's book  
Outworths a noble's blood. /

**NORFOLK**  
/ What, are you chafed?  
Ask God for temperance; that's the appliance only  
Which your disease requires. /

**BUCKINGHAM**  
/ I read in's looks  
Matter against me; and his eye reviled  
Me, as his abject object: at this instant  
He bores me with some trick: he's gone to the king;  
I'll follow and outstare him. /

**NORFOLK**  
/ Stay, my lord,  
And let your reason with your choler question  
What 'tis you go about: to climb steep hills  
Requires slow pace at first: anger is like  
A full-hot horse, who being allow'd his way,  
Self-mettle tires him. Not a man in England  
Can advise me like you: be to yourself  
As you would to your friend. /

**BUCKINGHAM**  
/ I'll to the king;  
And from a mouth of honour quite cry down  
This Ipswich fellow's insolence; or proclaim  
There's difference in no persons. /

**NORFOLK**  
/ Be advised;  
Heat not a furnace for your foe so hot  
That it do singe yourself: we may outrun,  
By violent swiftness, that which we run at,  
And lose by over-running. Know you not,  
The fire that mounts the liquor til run o'er,  
In seeming to augment it wastes it? Be advised:  
I say again, there is no English soul  
More stronger to direct you than yourself,  
If with the sap of reason you would quench,  
Or but allay, the fire of passion. /

**BUCKINGHAM**  
/ Sir,  
I am thankful to you; and I'll go along  
By your prescription: but this top-proud fellow,  
Whom from the flow of gall I name not but  
From sincere motions, by intelligence,  
And proofs as clear as founts in July when  
We see each grain of gravel, I do know  
To be corrupt and treasonous. /

**NORFOLK**  
/ Say not 'treasonous.'

**BUCKINGHAM**  
To the king I'll say't; and make my vouch as strong  
As shore of rock. Attend. This holy fox,  
Or wolf, or both,--for he is equal ravenous  
As he is subtle, and as prone to mischief  
As able to perform't; his mind and place  
Infecting one another, yea, reciprocally--  
Only to show his pomp as well in France  
As here at home, suggests the king our master  
To this last costly treaty, the interview,  
That swallow'd so much treasure, and like a glass  
Did break i' the rinsing. /

**NORFOLK**  
/ Faith, and so it did.

**BUCKINGHAM**  
Pray, give me favour, sir. This cunning cardinal  
The articles o' the combination drew  
As himself pleased; and they were ratified  
As he cried 'Thus let be': to as much end  
As give a crutch to the dead: but our count-cardinal  
Has done this, and 'tis well; for worthy Wolsey,  
Who cannot err, he did it. Now this follows,--  
Which, as I take it, is a kind of puppy  
To the old dam, treason,--Charles the emperor,  
Under pretence to see the queen his aunt--  
For 'twas indeed his colour, but he came  
To whisper Wolsey,--here makes visitation:  
His fears were, that the interview betwixt  
England and France might, through their amity,  
Breed him some prejudice; for from this league  
Peep'd harms that menaced him: he privily  
Deals with our cardinal; and, as I trow,--  
Which I do well; for I am sure the emperor  
Paid ere he promised; whereby his suit was granted  
Ere it was ask'd; but when the way was made,  
And paved with gold, the emperor thus desired,  
That he would please to alter the king's course,  
And break the foresaid peace. Let the king know,  
As soon he shall by me, that thus the cardinal  
Does buy and sell his honour as he pleases,  
And for his own advantage. /

**NORFOLK**  
/ I am sorry  
To hear this of him; and could wish he were  
Something mistaken in't. /

**BUCKINGHAM**  
/ No, not a syllable:  
I do pronounce him in that very shape  
He shall appear in proof.

*Enter a Sergeant-at-arms.*

**Sergeant**  
My lord the Duke of Buckingham, and Earl  
Of Hereford, Stafford, and Northampton, I  
Arrest thee of high treason, in the name  
Of our most sovereign king. /

**BUCKINGHAM**  
/ Lo, you, my lord,  
The net has fall'n upon me! I shall perish  
Under device and practise. /

**Sergeant**  
/ I am sorry  
To see you ta'en from liberty, to look on  
The business present: 'tis his highness' pleasure  
You shall to the Tower. /

**BUCKINGHAM**  
/ It will help me nothing  
To plead mine innocence; for that dye is on me  
Which makes my whitest part black. The will of heaven  
Be done in this and all things! I obey.  
I am the shadow of poor Buckingham,  
Whose figure even this instant cloud puts on,  
By darkening my clear sun. My lord, farewell.

*Exeunt*

### SCENE II. The same. The council-chamber.

*Cornets. Enter KING HENRY VIII, leaning on CARDINAL
WOLSEY's shoulder, and the Secretary. CARDINAL WOLSEY
places himself under KING HENRY VIII's feet on his right
side*

**KING HENRY VIII**  
My life itself, and the best heart of it,  
Thanks you for this great care: I stood i' the level  
Of a full-charged confederacy, and give thanks  
To you that choked it. Let be call'd before us  
That gentleman of Buckingham's; in person  
I'll hear him his confessions justify;  
And point by point the treasons of his master  
He shall again relate.

*A noise within, crying 'Room for the Queen!' Enter QUEEN
KATHARINE, ushered by NORFOLK: she kneels. KING HENRY VIII
riseth from his state, takes her up, kisses and placeth
her by him*

**QUEEN KATHARINE**  
Nay, we must longer kneel: I am a suitor.

**KING HENRY VIII**  
Arise, and take place by us: half your suit  
Never name to us; you have half our power:  
The other moiety, ere you ask, is given;  
Repeat your will and take it. /

**QUEEN KATHARINE**  
/ Thank your majesty.  
That you would love yourself, and in that love  
Not unconsider'd leave your honour, nor  
The dignity of your office, is the point  
Of my petition. /

**KING HENRY VIII**  
/ Lady mine, proceed.

**QUEEN KATHARINE**  
I am solicited, not by a few,  
And those of true condition, that your subjects  
Are in great grievance: there have been commissions  
Sent down among 'em, which hath flaw'd the heart  
Of all their loyalties: wherein, although,  
My good lord cardinal, they vent reproaches  
Most bitterly on you, as putter on  
Of these exactions, yet the king our master--  
Whose honour heaven shield from soil!--even he escapes not  
Language unmannerly, yea, such which breaks  
The sides of loyalty, and almost appears  
In loud rebellion. /

**NORFOLK**  
/ Not almost appears,  
It doth appear; for, upon these taxations,  
The clothiers all, not able to maintain  
The many to them longing, have put off  
The spinsters, carders, fullers, weavers, who,  
Unfit for other life, compell'd by hunger  
And lack of other means, in desperate manner  
Daring the event to the teeth, are all in uproar,  
And danger serves among then! /

**KING HENRY VIII**  
/ Taxation!  
Wherein? and what taxation? My lord cardinal,  
You that are blamed for it alike with us,  
Know you of this taxation? /

**CARDINAL WOLSEY**  
/ Please you, sir,  
I know but of a single part, in aught  
Pertains to the state; and front but in that file  
Where others tell steps with me. /

**QUEEN KATHARINE**  
/ No, my lord,  
You know no more than others; but you frame  
Things that are known alike; which are not wholesome  
To those which would not know them, and yet must  
Perforce be their acquaintance. These exactions,  
Whereof my sovereign would have note, they are  
Most pestilent to the bearing; and, to bear 'em,  
The back is sacrifice to the load. They say  
They are devised by you; or else you suffer  
Too hard an exclamation. /

**KING HENRY VIII**  
/ Still exaction!  
The nature of it? in what kind, let's know,  
Is this exaction? /

**QUEEN KATHARINE**  
/ I am much too venturous  
In tempting of your patience; but am bolden'd  
Under your promised pardon. The subjects' grief  
Comes through commissions, which compel from each  
The sixth part of his substance, to be levied  
Without delay; and the pretence for this  
Is named, your wars in France: this makes bold mouths:  
Tongues spit their duties out, and cold hearts freeze  
Allegiance in them; their curses now  
Live where their prayers did: and it's come to pass,  
This tractable obedience is a slave  
To each incensed will. I would your highness  
Would give it quick consideration, for  
There is no primer business. /

**KING HENRY VIII**  
/ By my life,  
This is against our pleasure. /

**CARDINAL WOLSEY**  
/ And for me,  
I have no further gone in this than by  
A single voice; and that not pass'd me but  
By learned approbation of the judges. If I am  
Traduced by ignorant tongues, which neither know  
My faculties nor person, yet will be  
The chronicles of my doing, let me say  
'Tis but the fate of place, and the rough brake  
That virtue must go through. We must not stint  
Our necessary actions, in the fear  
To cope malicious censurers; whichever,  
As ravenous fishes, do a vessel follow  
That is new-trimm'd, but benefit no further  
Than vainly longing. What we oft do best,  
By sick interpreters, once weak ones, is  
Not ours, or not allow'd; what worst, as oft,  
Hitting a grosser quality, is cried up  
For our best act. If we shall stand still,  
In fear our motion will be mock'd or carp'd at,  
We should take root here where we sit, or sit  
State-statues only. /

**KING HENRY VIII**  
/ Things done well,  
And with a care, exempt themselves from fear;  
Things done without example, in their issue  
Are to be fear'd. Have you a precedent  
Of this commission? I believe, not any.  
We must not rend our subjects from our laws,  
And stick them in our will. Sixth part of each?  
A trembling contribution! Why, we take  
From every tree lop, bark, and part o' the timber;  
And, though we leave it with a root, thus hack'd,  
The air will drink the sap. To every county  
Where this is question'd send our letters, with  
Free pardon to each man that has denied  
The force of this commission: pray, look to't;  
I put it to your care. /

**CARDINAL WOLSEY**  
/ A word with you.

*\[To GARDINER]*  
Let there be letters writ to every shire,  
Of the king's grace and pardon. The grieved commons  
Hardly conceive of me; let it be noised  
That through our intercession this revokement  
And pardon comes: I shall anon advise you  
Further in the proceeding.

*Exit GARDINER*

*Enter Surveyor*

**QUEEN KATHARINE**  
I am sorry that the Duke of Buckingham  
Is run in your displeasure. /

**KING HENRY VIII**  
/ It grieves many:  
The gentleman is learn'd, and a most rare speaker;  
To nature none more bound; his training such,  
That he may furnish and instruct great teachers,  
And never seek for aid out of himself. Yet see,  
When these so noble benefits shall prove  
Not well disposed, the mind growing once corrupt,  
They turn to vicious forms, ten times more ugly  
Than ever they were fair. This man so complete,  
Who was enroll'd 'mongst wonders, and when we,  
Almost with ravish'd listening, could not find  
His hour of speech a minute; he, my lady,  
Hath into monstrous habits put the graces  
That once were his, and is become as black  
As if besmear'd in hell. Sit by us; you shall hear--  
This was his gentleman in trust--of him  
Things to strike honour sad. Bid him recount  
The fore-recited practises; whereof  
We cannot feel too little, hear too much.

**CARDINAL WOLSEY**  
Stand forth, and with bold spirit relate what you,  
Most like a careful subject, have collected  
Out of the Duke of Buckingham. /

**KING HENRY VIII**  
/ Speak freely.

**Surveyor**  
First, it was usual with him, every day  
It would infect his speech, that if the king  
Should without issue die, he'll carry it so  
To make the sceptre his: these very words  
I've heard him utter to his son-in-law,  
Lord Abergavenny; to whom by oath he menaced  
Revenge upon the cardinal.

**CARDINAL WOLSEY**  
Please your highness, note  
This dangerous conception in this point.  
Not friended by his wish, to your high person  
His will is most malignant; and it stretches  
Beyond you, to your friends.

**QUEEN KATHARINE**  
My learn'd lord cardinal,  
Deliver all with charity. /

**KING HENRY VIII**  
/ Speak on:  
How grounded he his title to the crown,  
Upon our fail? to this point hast thou heard him  
At any time speak aught? /

**Surveyor**  
/ He was brought to this  
By a vain prophecy of Nicholas Hopkins.

**KING HENRY VIII**  
What was that Hopkins? /

**Surveyor**  
/ Sir, a Chartreux friar,  
His confessor, who fed him every minute  
With words of sovereignty. /

**KING HENRY VIII**  
/ How know'st thou this?

**Surveyor**  
Not long before your highness sped to France,  
The duke being at the Rose, within the parish  
Saint Lawrence Poultney, did of me demand  
What was the speech among the Londoners  
Concerning the French journey: I replied,  
Men fear'd the French would prove perfidious,  
To the king's danger. Presently the duke  
Said, 'twas the fear, indeed; and that he doubted  
'Twould prove the verity of certain words  
Spoke by a holy monk; 'that oft,' says he,  
'Hath sent to me, wishing me to permit  
John de la Car, my chaplain, a choice hour  
To hear from him a matter of some moment:  
Whom after under the confession's seal  
He solemnly had sworn, that what he spoke  
My chaplain to no creature living, but  
To me, should utter, with demure confidence  
This pausingly ensued: neither the king nor's heirs,  
Tell you the duke, shall prosper: bid him strive  
To gain the love o' the commonalty: the duke  
Shall govern England.' /

**QUEEN KATHARINE**  
/ If I know you well,  
You were the duke's surveyor, and lost your office  
On the complaint o' the tenants: take good heed  
You charge not in your spleen a noble person  
And spoil your nobler soul: I say, take heed;  
Yes, heartily beseech you. /

**KING HENRY VIII**  
/ Let him on.  
Go forward. /

**Surveyor**  
/ On my soul, I'll speak but truth.  
I told my lord the duke, by the devil's illusions  
The monk might be deceived; and that 'twas dangerous for him  
To ruminate on this so far, until  
It forged him some design, which, being believed,  
It was much like to do: he answer'd, 'Tush,  
It can do me no damage;' adding further,  
That, had the king in his last sickness fail'd,  
The cardinal's and the Lady Lovell's heads  
Should have gone off. /

**KING HENRY VIII**  
/ Ha! what, so rank? Ah ha!  
There's mischief in this man: canst thou say further?

**Surveyor**  
I can, my liege. /

**KING HENRY VIII**  
/ Proceed. /

**Surveyor**  
/ Being at Greenwich,  
After your highness had reproved the duke  
About Sir William Blomer,--

**KING HENRY VIII**  
I remember  
Of such a time: being my sworn servant,  
The duke retain'd him his. But on; what hence?

**Surveyor**  
'If,' quoth he, 'I for this had been committed,  
As, to the Tower, I thought, I would have play'd  
The part my father meant to act upon  
The usurper Richard; who, being at Salisbury,  
Made suit to come in's presence; which if granted,  
As he made semblance of his duty, would  
Have put his knife to him.' /

**KING HENRY VIII**  
/ A giant traitor!

**CARDINAL WOLSEY**  
Now, madam, may his highness live in freedom,  
and this man out of prison?

**QUEEN KATHARINE**  
God mend all!

**KING HENRY VIII**  
There's something more would out of thee; what say'st?

**Surveyor**  
After 'the duke his father,' with 'the knife,'  
He stretch'd him, and, with one hand on his dagger,  
Another spread on's breast, mounting his eyes  
He did discharge a horrible oath; whose tenor  
Was,--were he evil used, he would outgo  
His father by as much as a performance  
Does an irresolute purpose. /

**KING HENRY VIII**  
/ There's his period,  
To sheathe his knife in us. He is attach'd;  
Call him to present trial: if he may  
Find mercy in the law, 'tis his: if none,  
Let him not seek 't of us: by day and night,  
He's traitor to the height.

*Exeunt*

### SCENE III. An ante-chamber in the palace.

*Enter Chamberlain and SANDS from one way; LOVELL from
another.*

**Chamberlain**  
What news, my lord Lovell? /

**LOVELL**  
/ Faith, my lord,  
I hear of none, but the new proclamation  
That's clapp'd upon the court-gate. /

**Chamberlain**  
/ What is't for?

**LOVELL**  
The reformation of our travell'd gallants,  
That fill the court with quarrels, talk, and tailors.

**Chamberlain**  
I'm glad 'tis there: now I would pray our monsieurs  
To think an English courtier may be wise,  
And never see the Louvre. /

**LOVELL**  
/ They must either,  
For so run the conditions, leave those remnants  
Of fool and feather that they got in France,  
With all their honourable point of ignorance  
Pertaining thereunto, as fights and fireworks,  
Abusing better men than they can be,  
Out of a foreign wisdom, renouncing clean  
The faith they have in tennis, and tall stockings,  
Short blister'd breeches, and those types of travel,  
And understand again like honest men;  
Or pack to their old playfellows: there, I take it,  
They may, 'cum privilegio,' wear away  
The lag end of their lewdness and be laugh'd at.

**SANDS**  
'Tis time to give 'em physic, their diseases  
Are grown so catching. /

**Chamberlain**  
/ What a loss our ladies  
Will have of these trim vanities! /

**LOVELL**  
/ Ay, marry,  
There will be woe indeed, lords: the sly whoresons  
Have got a speeding trick to lay down ladies;  
A French song and a fiddle has no fellow.

**SANDS**  
The devil fiddle 'em! I am glad they are going,  
For, sure, there's no converting of 'em: now  
An honest country lord, as I am, beaten  
A long time out of play, may bring his plainsong  
And have an hour of hearing; and, by'r lady,  
Held current music too. /

**Chamberlain**  
/ Well said, Lord Sands;  
Your colt's tooth is not cast yet. /

**SANDS**  
/ No, my lord;  
Nor shall not, while I have a stump. /

**Chamberlain**  
/ My lord,  
Whither were you a-going? /

**LOVELL**  
/ To the cardinal's:  
Your lordship is a guest too. /

**Chamberlain**  
/ O, 'tis true:  
This night he makes a supper, and a great one,  
To many lords and ladies; there will be  
The beauty of this kingdom, I'll assure you.

**LOVELL**  
That churchman bears a bounteous mind indeed,  
A hand as fruitful as the land that feeds us;  
His dews fall everywhere. /

**Chamberlain**  
/ No doubt he's noble;  
He had a black mouth that said other of him.

**SANDS**  
He may, my lord; has wherewithal: in him  
Sparing would show a worse sin than ill doctrine:  
Men of his way should be most liberal;  
They are set here for examples.

**Chamberlain**  
True, they are so:  
But few now give so great ones. My barge stays;  
Your lordship shall along. Come, good my lady,  
We shall be late else; which I would not be,  
For I was spoke to, with Sir Henry Guildford  
This night to be comptrollers. /

**LOVELL**  
/ I am your lordship's.

*Exeunt*

### SCENE IV. A Hall in York Place.

*A small table under a state for CARDINAL WOLSEY, a longer
table for the guests. Then enter ANNE and other Ladies as
guests* *from one door; Chamberlain, SANDS, and LOVELL
from another.*

**SANDS**  
My lord Lovell, had the cardinal  
But half my lay thoughts in him, some of these  
Should find a running banquet ere they rested,  
I think would better please 'em: by my life,  
They are a sweet society of fair ones.

**LOVELL**  
O, that your lordship were but now confessor  
To one or two of these! /

**SANDS**  
/ I would I were;  
They should find easy penance. /

**LOVELL**  
/ Faith, how easy?

**SANDS**  
As easy as a down-bed would afford it.

**Chamberlain**  
Sweet ladies, will it please you sit? Sir Harry,  
Place you that side; I'll take the charge of this:  
His grace is entering. Nay, you must not freeze;  
Two women placed together makes cold weather:  
My Lord Sands, you are one will keep 'em waking;  
Pray, sit between these ladies. /

**SANDS**  
/ By my faith,  
And thank your lordship. By your leave, sweet ladies:  
If I chance to talk a little wild, forgive me;  
I had it from my father. /

**ANNE**  
/ Was he mad, sir?

**SANDS**  
O, very mad, exceeding mad, in love too:  
But he would bite none; just as I do now,  
He would kiss you twenty with a breath.

*Kisses her*

**Chamberlain**  
Well said, my lord.  
So, now you're fairly seated. Gentlemen,  
The penance lies on you, if these fair ladies  
Pass away frowning. /

**SANDS**  
/ For my little cure,  
Let me alone.

*Enter CARDINAL WOLSEY, and takes his state*

**CARDINAL WOLSEY**  
You're welcome, my fair guests: that noble lady,  
Or gentleman, that is not freely merry,  
Is not my friend: this, to confirm my welcome;  
And to you all, good health. /

*Drinks*

**SANDS**  
/ Your grace is noble:  
Let me have such a bowl may hold my thanks,  
And save me so much talking. /

**CARDINAL WOLSEY**  
/ My Lord Sands,  
I am beholding to you: cheer your neighbours.  
Ladies, you are not merry: gentlemen,  
Whose fault is this? /

**SANDS**  
/ The red wine first must rise  
In their fair cheeks, my lord; then we shall have 'em  
Talk us to silence. /

**ANNE**  
/ You are a merry gamester,  
My Lord Sands. /

**SANDS**  
/ Yes, if I make my play.  
Here's to your ladyship: and pledge it, madam,  
For 'tis to such a thing,--

**ANNE**  
You cannot show me.

**SANDS**  
I told your grace they would talk anon.

*Drum and trumpet, chambers discharged*

**CARDINAL WOLSEY**  
What's that? /

**Chamberlain**  
/ Look out there, some of ye.

*Exit Servant*

**CARDINAL WOLSEY**  
What warlike voice,  
And to what end is this? Nay, ladies, fear not;  
By all the laws of war you're privileged.

*Re-enter Servant*

**Chamberlain**  
How now! what is't? /

**Servant**  
/ A noble troop of strangers;  
For so they seem: they've left their barge and landed;  
And hither make, as great ambassadors  
From foreign princes. /

**CARDINAL WOLSEY**  
/ Good lord chamberlain,  
Go, give 'em welcome; you can speak the French tongue;  
And, pray, receive 'em nobly, and conduct 'em  
Into our presence, where this heaven of beauty  
Shall shine at full upon them. Some attend him.

*Exit Chamberlain, attended. All rise, and tables removed*

You have now a broken banquet; but we'll mend it.  
A good digestion to you all: and once more  
I shower a welcome on ye; welcome all.

*Hautboys. Enter KING HENRY VIII and others, as masquers,
habited like shepherds, ushered by the Chamberlain. They
pass directly before CARDINAL WOLSEY, and gracefully
salute him*

A noble company! what are their pleasures?

**Chamberlain**  
Because they speak no English, thus they pray'd  
To tell your grace, that, having heard by fame  
Of this so noble and so fair assembly  
This night to meet here, they could do no less  
Out of the great respect they bear to beauty,  
But leave their flocks; and, under your fair conduct,  
Crave leave to view these ladies and entreat  
An hour of revels with 'em. /

**CARDINAL WOLSEY**  
/ Say, lord chamberlain,  
They have done my poor house grace; for which I pay 'em  
A thousand thanks, and pray 'em take their pleasures.

*They choose Ladies for the dance. KING HENRY VIII chooses
ANNE*

**KING HENRY VIII**  
The fairest hand I ever touch'd! O beauty,  
Till now I never knew thee!

*Music. Dance*

**CARDINAL WOLSEY**  
My lord! /

**Chamberlain**  
/ Your grace? /

**CARDINAL WOLSEY**  
/ Pray, tell 'em thus much from me:  
There should be one amongst 'em, by his person,  
More worthy this place than myself; to whom,  
If I but knew him, with my love and duty  
I would surrender it. /

**Chamberlain**  
/ I will, my lord.

*Whispers the Masquers*

**CARDINAL WOLSEY**  
What say they? /

**Chamberlain**  
/ Such a one, they all confess,  
There is indeed; which they would have your grace  
Find out, and he will take it. /

**CARDINAL WOLSEY**  
/ Let me see, then.  
By all your good leaves, gentlemen; here I'll make  
My royal choice. /

**KING HENRY VIII**  
/ Ye have found him, cardinal:

*\[Unmasking]*  
You hold a fair assembly; you do well, lord:  
You are a churchman, or, I'll tell you, cardinal,  
I should judge now unhappily. /

**CARDINAL WOLSEY**  
/ I am glad  
Your grace is grown so pleasant. /

**KING HENRY VIII**  
/ My lord chamberlain,  
Prithee, come hither: what fair lady's that?

**Chamberlain**  
An't please your grace, Sir Thomas Bullen's daughter--  
The Viscount Rochford,--one of her highness' women.

**KING HENRY VIII**  
By heaven, she is a dainty one. Sweetheart,  
I were unmannerly, to take you out,  
And not to kiss you. A health, gentlemen!  
Let it go round.

**CARDINAL WOLSEY**  
My lord Lovell, is the banquet ready  
I' the privy chamber? /

**LOVELL**  
/ Yes, my lord. /

**CARDINAL WOLSEY**  
/ Your grace,  
I fear, with dancing is a little heated.

**KING HENRY VIII**  
I fear, too much. /

**CARDINAL WOLSEY**  
/ There's fresher air, my lord,  
In the next chamber.

**KING HENRY VIII**  
Lead in your ladies, every one: sweet partner,  
I must not yet forsake you: let's be merry:  
Good my lord cardinal, I have half a dozen healths  
To drink to these fair ladies, and a measure  
To lead 'em once again; and then let's dream  
Who's best in favour. Let the music knock it.

*Exeunt with trumpets*

## ACT II

### SCENE I. Westminster. A street.

*Enter BUCKINGHAM from his arraignment; tip-staves before
him; the axe with the edge towards him; accompanied with
LOVELL*

**BUCKINGHAM**  
All good people,  
You that thus far have come to pity me,  
Hear what I say, and then go home and lose me.  
I have this day received a traitor's judgment,  
And by that name must die: yet, heaven bear witness,  
And if I have a conscience, let it sink me,  
Even as the axe falls, if I be not faithful!  
The law I bear no malice for my death;  
'T has done, upon the premises, but justice:  
But those that sought it I could wish more Christians:  
Be what they will, I heartily forgive 'em:  
Yet let 'em look they glory not in mischief,  
Nor build their evils on the graves of great men;  
For then my guiltless blood must cry against 'em.  
For further life in this world I ne'er hope,  
Nor will I sue, although the king have mercies  
More than I dare make faults. You few that loved me,  
And dare be bold to weep for Buckingham,  
His noble friends and fellows, whom to leave  
Is only bitter to him, only dying,  
Go with me, like good angels, to my end;  
And, as the long divorce of steel falls on me,  
Make of your prayers one sweet sacrifice,  
And lift my soul to heaven. Lead on, o' God's name.

**LOVELL**  
I do beseech your grace, for charity,  
If ever any malice in your heart  
Were hid against me, now to forgive me frankly.

**BUCKINGHAM**  
My lord Lovell, I as free forgive you  
As I would be forgiven: I forgive all;  
There cannot be those numberless offences  
'Gainst me, that I cannot take peace with: no black envy  
Shall mark my grave. Commend me to his grace;  
And if he speak of Buckingham, pray, tell him  
You met him half in heaven: my vows and prayers  
Yet are the king's; and, till my soul forsake,  
Shall cry for blessings on him: may he live  
Longer than I have time to tell his years!  
Ever beloved and loving may his rule be!  
And when old time shall lead him to his end,  
Goodness and he fill up one monument!  
My noble father, Henry of Buckingham,  
Who first raised head against usurping Richard,  
Flying for succor to his servant Banister,  
Being distress'd, was by that wretch betray'd,  
And without trial fell; God's peace be with him!  
Henry the Seventh succeeding, truly pitying  
My father's loss, like a most royal prince,  
Restored me to my honours, and, out of ruins,  
Made my name once more noble. Now his son,  
Henry the Eighth, life, honour, name and all  
That made me happy at one stroke has taken  
Forever from the world. I had my trial,  
And, must needs say, a noble one; which makes me,  
A little happier than my wretched father:  
Yet thus far we are one in fortunes: both  
Fell by our servants, by those men we loved most;  
A most unnatural and faithless service!  
Heaven has an end in all: yet, you that hear me,  
This from a dying man receive as certain:  
Where you are liberal of your loves and counsels  
Be sure you be not loose; for those you make friends  
And give your hearts to, when they once perceive  
The least rub in your fortunes, fall away  
Like water from ye, never found again  
But where they mean to sink ye. All good people,  
Pray for me! I must now forsake ye: the last hour  
Of my long weary life is come upon me. Farewell:  
And when you would say something that is sad,  
Speak how I fell. I have done; and God forgive me!

*Exeunt.*

### SCENE II. An ante-chamber in the palace. Chamberlain on stage.

*Enter, to Chamberlain, NORFOLK and SUFFOLK*

**NORFOLK**  
Well met, my lord chamberlain.

**Chamberlain**  
Good day to both your graces.

**SUFFOLK**  
How is the king employ'd? /

**Chamberlain**  
/ I left him private,  
Full of sad thoughts and troubles. /

**NORFOLK**  
/ What's the cause?

**Chamberlain**  
It seems the marriage with his brother's wife  
Has crept too near his conscience. /

**SUFFOLK**  
/ No, his conscience  
Has crept too near another lady. /

**NORFOLK**  
/ 'Tis so:  
This is the cardinal's doing, the king-cardinal:  
That blind priest, like the eldest son of fortune,  
Turns what he list. The king will know him one day.

**SUFFOLK**  
Pray God he do! he'll never know himself else.

**NORFOLK**  
How holily he works in all his business!  
And with what zeal! for, now he has crack'd the league  
Between us and the emperor, the queen's great nephew,  
He dives into the king's soul, and there scatters  
Dangers, doubts, wringing of the conscience,  
Fears, and despairs; and all these for his marriage:  
And out of all these to restore the king,  
He counsels a divorce; a loss of her  
That, like a jewel, has hung twenty years  
About his neck, yet never lost her lustre.

**SUFFOLK**  
As I am made without him, so I'll stand,  
If the king please; his curses and his blessings  
Touch me alike, they're breath I not believe in.  
I knew him, and I know him; so I leave him  
To him that made him proud, the pope. /

**NORFOLK**  
/ Let's in;  
And with some other business put the king  
From these sad thoughts, that work too much upon him:  
My lord, you'll bear us company? /

**Chamberlain**  
/ Excuse me;  
The king has sent me otherwhere: besides,  
You'll find a most unfit time to disturb him:  
Health to your lordships. /

**NORFOLK**  
/ Thanks, my good lord chamberlain.

*Exit Chamberlain; and KING HENRY VIII draws the curtain,
and sits reading pensively*

**SUFFOLK**  
How sad he looks! sure, he is much afflicted.

**KING HENRY VIII**  
Who's there, ha? /

**NORFOLK**  
/ Pray God he be not angry.

**KING HENRY VIII**  
Who's there, I say? How dare you thrust yourselves  
Into my private meditations?  
Who am I? ha?

**NORFOLK**  
A gracious king that pardons all offences  
Malice ne'er meant: our breach of duty this way  
Is business of estate; in which we come  
To know your royal pleasure. /

**KING HENRY VIII**  
/ Ye are too bold:  
Go to; I'll make ye know your times of business:  
Is this an hour for temporal affairs, ha?

*Enter CARDINAL WOLSEY and CARDINAL CAMPEIUS, with a commission*

Who's there? my good lord cardinal? O my Wolsey,  
The quiet of my wounded conscience;  
Thou art a cure fit for a king. /

*\[To CARDINAL CAMPEIUS]*  
/ You're welcome,  
Most learned reverend sir, into our kingdom:  
Use us and it. /

*\[To CARDINAL WOLSEY]*  
/ My good lord, have great care  
I be not found a talker. /

**CARDINAL WOLSEY**  
/ Sir, you cannot.  
I would your grace would give us but an hour  
Of private conference. /

**KING HENRY VIII**  
*\[To NORFOLK and SUFFOLK]*  
/ We are busy; go.

*Exeunt NORFOLK and SUFFOLK*

**CARDINAL WOLSEY**  
Your grace has given a precedent of wisdom  
Above all princes, in committing freely  
Your scruple to the voice of Christendom:  
Who can be angry now? what envy reach you?  
The Spaniard, tied blood and favour to her,  
Must now confess, if they have any goodness,  
The trial just and noble. All the clerks,  
I mean the learned ones, in Christian kingdoms  
Have their free voices: Rome, the nurse of judgment,  
Invited by your noble self, hath sent  
One general tongue unto us, this good man,  
This just and learned priest, Cardinal Campeius;  
Whom once more I present unto your highness.

**KING HENRY VIII**  
And once more in mine arms I bid him welcome,  
And thank the holy conclave for their loves:  
They have sent me such a man I would have wish'd for.

**CARDINAL CAMPEIUS**  
Your grace must needs deserve all strangers' loves,  
You are so noble. To your highness' hand  
I tender my commission; by whose virtue,  
The court of Rome commanding, you, my lord  
Cardinal of York, are join'd with me their servant  
In the unpartial judging of this business.

**KING HENRY VIII**  
Two equal men. The queen shall be acquainted  
Forthwith for what you come. Where's Gardiner?

**CARDINAL WOLSEY**  
I know your majesty has always loved her  
So dear in heart, not to deny her that  
A woman of less place might ask by law:  
Scholars allow'd freely to argue for her.

**KING HENRY VIII**  
Ay, and the best she shall have; and my favour  
To him that does best: God forbid else. Cardinal,  
Prithee, call Gardiner to me, my new secretary:  
I find him a fit fellow.

*Exit CARDINAL WOLSEY*

*Re-enter CARDINAL WOLSEY, with GARDINER*

**CARDINAL WOLSEY**  
*\[Aside to GARDINER]*  
Give me your hand. Much joy and favour to you;  
You are the king's now. /

**GARDINER**  
*\[Aside to CARDINAL WOLSEY]*  
/ But to be commanded  
Forever by your grace, whose hand has raised me.

**KING HENRY VIII**  
Come hither, Gardiner.

*\[Gives him a letter]*  
Deliver this with modesty to the queen.

*Exit GARDINER*

The most convenient place that I can think of  
For such receipt of learning is Black-Friars;  
There ye shall meet about this weighty business.  
My Wolsey, see it furnish'd. O, my lord,  
Would it not grieve an able man to leave  
So sweet a bedfellow? But, conscience, conscience!  
O, 'tis a tender place; and I must leave her.

*Exeunt*

### SCENE III. An ante-chamber of the QUEEN'S apartments.

*Enter ANNE and an Old Lady*

**ANNE**  
Not for that neither: here's the pang that pinches:  
His highness having lived so long with her, and she  
So good a lady that no tongue could ever  
Pronounce dishonour of her; by my life,  
She never knew harm-doing: O, now, after  
So many courses of the sun enthroned,  
Still growing in a majesty and pomp, the which  
To leave a thousand-fold more bitter than  
'Tis sweet at first to acquire,--after this process,  
To give her the avaunt! it is a pity  
Would move a monster. /

**Old Lady**  
/ Hearts of most hard temper  
Melt and lament for her. /

**ANNE**  
/ O, God's will! much better  
She ne'er had known pomp: though't be temporal,  
Yet, if that quarrel, fortune, do divorce  
It from the bearer, 'tis a sufferance panging  
As soul and body's severing. /

**Old Lady**  
/ Alas, poor lady!  
She's a stranger now again. /

**ANNE**  
/ So much the more  
Must pity drop upon her. Verily,  
I swear, 'tis better to be lowly born,  
And range with humble livers in content,  
Than to be perk'd up in a glistering grief,  
And wear a golden sorrow. /

**Old Lady**  
/ Our content  
Is our best having. /

**ANNE**  
/ By my troth and maidenhead,  
I would not be a queen. /

**Old Lady**  
/ Beshrew me, I would,  
And venture maidenhead for't; and so would you,  
For all this spice of your hypocrisy:  
You, that have so fair parts of woman on you,  
Have too a woman's heart; whichever yet  
Affected eminence, wealth, sovereignty;  
Which, to say sooth, are blessings; and which gifts,  
Saving your mincing, the capacity  
Of your soft cheveril conscience would receive,  
If you might please to stretch it. /

**ANNE**  
/ Nay, good troth.

**Old Lady**  
Yes, troth, and troth; you would not be a queen?

**ANNE**  
No, not for all the riches under heaven.

**Old Lady**  
'Tis strange: a three-pence bow'd would hire me,  
Old as I am, to queen it: but, I pray you,  
What think you of a duchess? have you limbs  
To bear that load of title? /

**ANNE**  
/ No, in truth.

**Old Lady**  
Then you are weakly made: pluck off a little;  
I would not be a young count in your way,  
For more than blushing comes to: if your back  
Cannot vouchsafe this burthen,'tis too weak  
Ever to get a boy. /

**ANNE**  
/ How you do talk!  
I swear again, I would not be a queen  
For all the world. /

**Old Lady**  
/ In faith, for little England  
You'ld venture an emballing: I myself  
Would for Carnarvonshire, although there long'd  
No more to the crown but that. Lo, who comes here?

*Enter Chamberlain*

**Chamberlain**  
Good morrow, ladies. What were't worth to know  
The secret of your conference? /

**ANNE**  
/ My good lord,  
Not your demand; it values not your asking:  
Our mistress' sorrows we were pitying.

**Chamberlain**  
It was a gentle business, and becoming  
The action of good women: there is hope  
All will be well. /

**ANNE**  
/ Now, I pray God, amen!

**Chamberlain**  
You bear a gentle mind, and heavenly blessings  
Follow such creatures. That you may, fair lady,  
Perceive I speak sincerely, and high note's  
Ta'en of your many virtues, the king's majesty  
Commends his good opinion of you, and  
Does purpose honour to you no less flowing  
Than Marchioness of Pembroke: to which title  
A thousand pound a year, annual support,  
Out of his grace he adds. /

**ANNE**  
/ I do not know  
What kind of my obedience I should tender;  
More than my all is nothing: nor my prayers  
Are not words duly hallow'd, nor my wishes  
More worth than empty vanities; yet prayers and wishes  
Are all I can return. Beseech your lordship,  
Vouchsafe to speak my thanks and my obedience,  
As from a blushing handmaid, to his highness;  
Whose health and royalty I pray for. /

**Chamberlain**  
/ Lady,  
I shall not fail to approve the fair conceit  
The king hath of you. /

*\[Aside]*  
/ I have perused her well;  
Beauty and honour in her are so mingled  
That they have caught the king: and who knows yet  
But from this lady may proceed a gem  
To lighten all this isle? I'll to the king,  
And say I spoke with you.

*Exit Chamberlain*

**ANNE**  
My honour'd lord. /

**Old Lady**  
/ Why, this it is; see, see!  
I have been begging sixteen years in court,  
Am yet a courtier beggarly, nor could  
Come pat betwixt too early and too late  
For any suit of pounds; and you, O fate!  
A very fresh-fish here--fie, fie, fie upon  
This compell'd fortune!--have your mouth fill'd up  
Before you open it. /

**ANNE**  
/ This is strange to me.

**Old Lady**  
How tastes it? is it bitter? forty pence, no.  
There was a lady once, 'tis an old story,  
That would not be a queen, that would she not,  
For all the mud in Egypt: have you heard it?

**ANNE**  
Come, you are pleasant. /

**Old Lady**  
/ With your theme, I could  
O'ermount the lark. The Marchioness of Pembroke!  
A thousand pounds a year for pure respect!  
No other obligation! By my life,  
That promises moe thousands: honour's train  
Is longer than his foreskirt. By this time  
I know your back will bear a duchess: say,  
Are you not stronger than you were? /

**ANNE**  
/ Good lady,  
Make yourself mirth with your particular fancy,  
And leave me out on't. Would I had no being,  
If this salute my blood a jot: it faints me,  
To think what follows.  
The queen is comfortless, and we forgetful  
In our long absence: pray, do not deliver  
What here you've heard to her. /

**Old Lady**  
/ What do you think me?

*Exeunt*

### SCENE IV. A hall in Black-Friars.

*Trumpets, sennet, and cornets. Enter GRIFFITH bearing the
purse, with the great seal, and a cardinal's hat; after
him, side by side, CARDINAL WOLSEY and CARDINAL CAMPEIUS.
KING HENRY VIII takes place under the cloth of state;
CARDINAL WOLSEY and CARDINAL CAMPEIUS sit under him as
judges. QUEEN KATHARINE takes place some distance from
KING HENRY VIII. QUEEN KATHARINE rises out of her chair,
goes about the court, comes to KING HENRY VIII, and kneels
at his feet; then speaks*

**QUEEN KATHARINE**  
Sir, I desire you do me right and justice;  
And to bestow your pity on me: for  
I am a most poor woman, and a stranger,  
Born out of your dominions; having here  
No judge indifferent, nor no more assurance  
Of equal friendship and proceeding. Alas, sir,  
In what have I offended you? what cause  
Hath my behavior given to your displeasure,  
That thus you should proceed to put me off,  
And take your good grace from me? Heaven witness,  
I have been to you a true and humble wife,  
At all times to your will conformable;  
Ever in fear to kindle your dislike,  
Yea, subject to your countenance, glad or sorry  
As I saw it inclined: when was the hour  
I ever contradicted your desire,  
Or made it not mine too? Or which of your friends  
Have I not strove to love, although I knew  
He were mine enemy? what friend of mine  
That had to him derived your anger, did I  
Continue in my liking? nay, gave notice  
He was from thence discharged. Sir, call to mind  
That I have been your wife, in this obedience,  
Upward of twenty years, and have been blest  
With many children by you: if, in the course  
And process of this time, you can report,  
And prove it too, against mine honour aught,  
My bond to wedlock, or my love and duty,  
Against your sacred person, in God's name,  
Turn me away; and let the foul'st contempt  
Shut door upon me, and so give me up  
To the sharp'st kind of justice. Please you sir,  
The king, your father, was reputed for  
A prince most prudent, of an excellent  
And unmatch'd wit and judgment: Ferdinand,  
My father, king of Spain, was reckon'd one  
The wisest prince that there had reign'd by many  
A year before: it is not to be question'd  
That they had gather'd a wise council to them  
Of every realm, that did debate this business,  
Who deem'd our marriage lawful: wherefore I humbly  
Beseech you, sir, to spare me, till I may  
Be by my friends in Spain advised; whose counsel  
I will implore: if not, i' the name of God,  
Your pleasure be fulfill'd! /

**CARDINAL WOLSEY**  
/ You have here, lady,  
And of your choice, these reverend fathers; men  
Of singular integrity and learning,  
Yea, the elect o' the land, who are assembled  
To plead your cause: it shall be therefore bootless  
That longer you desire the court; as well  
For your own quiet, as to rectify  
What is unsettled in the king. /

**CARDINAL CAMPEIUS**  
/ His grace  
Hath spoken well and justly: therefore, madam,  
It's fit this royal session do proceed;  
And that, without delay, their arguments  
Be now produced and heard. /

**QUEEN KATHARINE**  
/ Lord cardinal,  
To you I speak. /

**CARDINAL WOLSEY**  
/ Your pleasure, madam? /

**QUEEN KATHARINE**  
/ Sir,  
I am about to weep; but, thinking that  
We are a queen, or long have dream'd so, certain  
The daughter of a king, my drops of tears  
I'll turn to sparks of fire. /

**CARDINAL WOLSEY**  
/ Be patient yet.

**QUEEN KATHARINE**  
I will, when you are humble; nay, before,  
Or God will punish me. I do believe,  
Induced by potent circumstances, that  
You are mine enemy, and make my challenge  
You shall not be my judge: for it is you  
Have blown this coal betwixt my lord and me;  
Which God's dew quench! Therefore I say again,  
I utterly abhor, yea, from my soul  
Refuse you for my judge; whom, yet once more,  
I hold my most malicious foe, and think not  
At all a friend to truth. /

**CARDINAL WOLSEY**  
/ I do profess  
You speak not like yourself; whoever yet  
Have stood to charity, and display'd the effects  
Of disposition gentle, and of wisdom  
O'ertopping woman's power. Madam, you do me wrong:  
I have no spleen against you; nor injustice  
For you or any: how far I have proceeded,  
Or how far further shall, is warranted  
By a commission from the consistory,  
Yea, the whole consistory of Rome. You charge me  
That I have blown this coal: I do deny it:  
The king is present: if it be known to him  
That I gainsay my deed, how may he wound,  
And worthily, my falsehood! yea, as much  
As you have done my truth. If he know  
That I am free of your report, he knows  
I am not of your wrong. Therefore in him  
It lies to cure me: and the cure is, to  
Remove these thoughts from you: the which before  
His highness shall speak in, I do beseech  
You, gracious madam, to unthink your speaking  
And to say so no more. /

**QUEEN KATHARINE**  
/ My lord, my lord,  
I am a simple woman, much too weak  
To oppose your cunning. You're meek and humble-mouth'd;  
You sign your place and calling, in full seeming,  
With meekness and humility; but your heart  
Is cramm'd with arrogancy, spleen, and pride.  
You have, by fortune and his highness' favours,  
Gone slightly o'er low steps and now are mounted  
Where powers are your retainers, and your words,  
Domestics to you, serve your will as't please  
Yourself pronounce their office. I must tell you,  
You tender more your person's honour than  
Your high profession spiritual: that again  
I do refuse you for my judge; and here,  
Before you all, appeal unto the pope,  
To bring my whole cause 'fore his holiness,  
And to be judged by him. /

*She curtsies to KING HENRY VIII, and offers to depart*

**CARDINAL CAMPEIUS**  
/ The queen is obstinate,  
Stubborn to justice, apt to accuse it, and  
Disdainful to be tried by't: 'tis not well.  
She's going away. /

**KING HENRY VIII**  
/ Call her again.

**GRIFFITH**  
Madam, you are call'd back.

**QUEEN KATHARINE**  
What need you note it? pray you, keep your way:  
When you are call'd, return. Now, the Lord help,  
They vex me past my patience! Pray you, pass on:  
I will not tarry; no, nor ever more  
Upon this business my appearance make  
In any of their courts. /

*Exeunt QUEEN KATHARINE*

**KING HENRY VIII**  
/ Go thy ways, Kate:  
That man i'the world who shall report he has  
A better wife, let him in nought be trusted,  
For speaking false in that: thou art, alone,  
If thy rare qualities, sweet gentleness,  
Thy meekness saint-like, wife-like government,  
Obeying in commanding, and thy parts  
Sovereign and pious else, could speak thee out,  
The queen of earthly queens: she's noble born;  
And, like her true nobility, she has  
Carried herself towards me. /

**CARDINAL WOLSEY**  
/ Most gracious sir,  
In humblest manner I require your highness,  
That it shall please you to declare, in hearing  
Of all these ears,--for where I am robb'd and bound,  
There must I be unloosed, although not there  
At once and fully satisfied,--whether ever I  
Did broach this business to your highness; or  
Laid any scruple in your way, which might  
Induce you to the question on't? or ever  
Have to you, but with thanks to God for such  
A royal lady, spake one the least word that might  
Be to the prejudice of her present state,  
Or touch of her good person? /

**KING HENRY VIII**  
/ My lord cardinal,  
I do excuse you; yea, upon mine honour,  
I free you from't. You are not to be taught  
That you have many enemies, that know not  
Why they are so, but, like to village-curs,  
Bark when their fellows do: by some of these  
The queen is put in anger. You're excused:  
But will you be more justified? You ever  
Have wish'd the sleeping of this business; never desired  
It to be stirr'd; but oft have hinder'd, oft,  
The passages made toward it: on my honour,  
I speak my good lord cardinal to this point,  
And thus far clear him. Now, what moved me to't,  
I will be bold with time and your attention:  
Then mark the inducement. Thus it came; give heed to't:  
My conscience first received a tenderness,  
Scruple, and prick, on certain speeches utter'd  
By the Bishop of Bayonne, then French ambassador;  
Who had been hither sent on the debating  
A marriage 'twixt the Duke of Orleans and  
Our daughter Mary: i'the progress of this business,  
Ere a determinate resolution, he,  
I mean the bishop, did require a respite;  
Wherein he might the king his lord advertise  
Whether our daughter were legitimate,  
Respecting this our marriage with the dowager,  
Sometimes our brother's wife. This respite shook  
The bosom of my conscience, enter'd me,  
Yea, with a splitting power, and made to tremble  
The region of my breast; which forced such way,  
That many mazed considerings did throng  
And press'd in with this caution. First, methought  
I stood not in the smile of heaven; who had  
Commanded nature, that my lady's womb,  
If it conceived a male child by me, should  
Do no more offices of life to't than  
The grave does to the dead; for her male issue  
Or died where they were made, or shortly after  
This world had air'd them: hence I took a thought,  
This was a judgment on me; that my kingdom,  
Well worthy the best heir o' the world, should not  
Be gladded in't by me: then follows, that  
I weigh'd the danger which my realms stood in  
By this my issue's fail; and that gave to me  
Many a groaning throe. Thus hulling in  
The wild sea of my conscience, I did steer  
Toward this remedy, whereupon we are  
Now present here together: that's to say,  
I meant to rectify my conscience,--which  
I then did feel full sick, and yet not well,--  
By all the reverend fathers of the land  
And doctors learn'd: first I began in private  
With you, my good lord Griffith; you remember  
How under my oppression I did reek,  
When I first moved you. /

**GRIFFITH**  
/ Very well, my liege.

**KING HENRY VIII**  
I have spoke long: be pleased yourself to say  
How far you satisfied me. /

**GRIFFITH**  
/ So please your highness,  
The question did at first so stagger me,  
Bearing a state of mighty moment in't  
And consequence of dread, that I committed  
The daring'st counsel which I had to doubt;  
And did entreat your highness to this course  
Which you are running here. /

**KING HENRY VIII**  
/ I then moved to  
My Lord of Canterbury; and got his leave  
To make this present summons: unsolicited  
I left no reverend person in this court;  
But by particular consent proceeded  
Under his hands and seals: therefore, go on:  
For no dislike i' the world against the person  
Of the good queen, but the sharp thorny points  
Of my alleged reasons, drive this forward:  
Prove but our marriage lawful, by my life  
And kingly dignity, we are contented  
To wear our mortal state to come with her,  
Katharine our queen, before the primest creature  
That's paragon'd o' the world. /

**CARDINAL CAMPEIUS**  
/ So please your highness,  
The queen being absent, 'tis a needful fitness  
That we adjourn this court till further day:  
Meanwhile must be an earnest motion  
Made to the queen, to call back her appeal  
She intends unto his holiness. /

**KING HENRY VIII**  
*\[Aside]*  
/ I may perceive  
These cardinals trifle with me: I abhor  
This dilatory sloth and tricks of Rome.

My learn'd and well-beloved servant, Cranmer,  
Prithee, return: with thy approach, I know,  
My comfort comes along. Break up the court:  
I say, set on.

*Exeunt in manner as they entered*

## ACT III

### SCENE I. London. QUEEN KATHARINE's apartments.

*Enter QUEEN KATHARINE as at work.*

*Enter GRIFFITH.*

**QUEEN KATHARINE**  
How now!

**GRIFFITH**  
An't please your grace, the two great cardinals  
Wait in the presence. /

**QUEEN KATHARINE**  
/ Would they speak with me?

**GRIFFITH**  
They will'd me say so, madam. /

**QUEEN KATHARINE**  
/ Pray their graces  
To come near. /

*Exit GRIFFITH*

/ What can be their business  
With me, a poor weak woman, fall'n from favour?  
I do not like their coming. Now I think on't,  
They should be good men; their affairs as righteous:  
But all hoods make not monks. /

*Enter CARDINAL WOLSEY and CARDINAL CAMPEIUS*

**CARDINAL WOLSEY**  
/ Peace to your highness!

**QUEEN KATHARINE**  
Your graces find me here part of a housewife,  
I would be all, against the worst may happen.  
What are your pleasures with me, reverend lords?

**CARDINAL WOLSEY**  
We come not by the way of accusation,  
To taint that honour every good tongue blesses,  
Nor to betray you any way to sorrow,  
You have too much, good lady; but to know  
How you stand minded in the weighty difference  
Between the king and you; and to deliver,  
Like free and honest men, our just opinions  
And comforts to your cause. /

**CARDINAL CAMPEIUS**  
/ Most honour'd madam,  
My Lord of York, out of his noble nature,  
Zeal and obedience he still bore your grace,  
Forgetting, like a good man your late censure  
Both of his truth and him, which was too far,  
Offers, as I do, in a sign of peace,  
His service and his counsel. /

**QUEEN KATHARINE**  
*\[Aside]*  
/ To betray me.--

My lords, I thank you both for your good wills;  
Ye speak like honest men; pray God, ye prove so!  
But how to make ye suddenly an answer,  
In such a point of weight, so near mine honour,--  
More near my life, I fear,--with my weak wit,  
And to such men of gravity and learning,  
In truth, I know not. I was set at work  
Among my maids: full little, God knows, looking  
Either for such men or such business.  
For her sake that I have been,--for I feel  
The last fit of my greatness,--good your graces,  
Let me have time and counsel for my cause:  
Alas, I am a woman, friendless, hopeless!

**CARDINAL WOLSEY**  
Madam, you wrong the king's love with these fears:  
Your hopes and friends are infinite. /

**QUEEN KATHARINE**  
/ In England  
But little for my profit: can you think, lords,  
That any Englishman dare give me counsel?  
Or be a known friend, 'gainst his highness' pleasure,  
Though he be grown so desperate to be honest,  
And live a subject? Nay, forsooth, my friends,  
They that must weigh out my afflictions,  
They that my trust must grow to, live not here:  
They are, as all my other comforts, far hence  
In mine own country, lords. /

**CARDINAL CAMPEIUS**  
/ I would your grace  
Would leave your griefs, and take my counsel. /

**QUEEN KATHARINE**  
/ How, sir?

**CARDINAL CAMPEIUS**  
Put your main cause into the king's protection;  
He's loving and most gracious: 'twill be much  
Both for your honour better and your cause;  
For if the trial of the law o'ertake ye,  
You'll part away disgraced. /

**CARDINAL WOLSEY**  
/ He tells you rightly.

**QUEEN KATHARINE**  
Ye tell me what ye wish for both,--my ruin:  
Is this your Christian counsel? out upon ye!  
Heaven is above all yet; there sits a judge  
That no king can corrupt. /

**CARDINAL CAMPEIUS**  
/ Your rage mistakes us.

**QUEEN KATHARINE**  
The more shame for ye: holy men I thought ye,  
Upon my soul, two reverend cardinal virtues;  
But cardinal sins and hollow hearts I fear ye:  
Mend 'em, for shame, my lords. Is this your comfort?  
The cordial that ye bring a wretched lady,  
A woman lost among ye, laugh'd at, scorn'd?  
I will not wish ye half my miseries;  
I have more charity: but say, I warn'd ye;  
Take heed, for heaven's sake, take heed, lest at once  
The burthen of my sorrows fall upon ye.

**CARDINAL WOLSEY**  
Madam, this is a mere distraction;  
You turn the good we offer into envy.

**QUEEN KATHARINE**  
Ye turn me into nothing: woe upon ye  
And all such false professors! would you have me--  
If you have any justice, any pity;  
If ye be anything but churchmen's habits--  
Put my sick cause into his hands that hates me?  
Alas, has banish'd me his bed already,  
His love, too long ago! I am old, my lords,  
And all the fellowship I hold now with him  
Is only my obedience. What can happen  
To me above this wretchedness? all your studies  
Make me a curse like this. /

**CARDINAL CAMPEIUS**  
/ Your fears are worse.

**QUEEN KATHARINE**  
Have I lived thus long--let me speak myself,  
Since virtue finds no friends--a wife, a true one?  
A woman, I dare say without vain-glory,  
Never yet branded with suspicion?  
Have I with all my full affections  
Still met the king? loved him next heaven? obey'd him?  
Been, out of fondness, superstitious to him?  
Almost forgot my prayers to content him?  
And am I thus rewarded? 'tis not well, lords.  
Bring me a constant woman to her husband,  
One that ne'er dream'd a joy beyond his pleasure;  
And to that woman, when she has done most,  
Yet will I add an honour, a great patience.

**CARDINAL WOLSEY**  
Madam, you wander from the good we aim at.

**QUEEN KATHARINE**  
My lord, I dare not make myself so guilty,  
To give up willingly that noble title  
Your master wed me to: nothing but death  
Shall e'er divorce my dignities. /

**CARDINAL WOLSEY**  
/ Pray, hear me.

**QUEEN KATHARINE**  
Would I had never trod this English earth,  
Or felt the flatteries that grow upon it!  
Ye have angels' faces, but heaven knows your hearts.  
What will become of me now, wretched lady!  
I am the most unhappy woman living.  
I'll hang my head and perish. /

**CARDINAL WOLSEY**  
/ If your grace  
Could but be brought to know our ends are honest,  
You'ld feel more comfort: why should we, good lady,  
Upon what cause, wrong you? alas, our places,  
The way of our profession is against it:  
We are to cure such sorrows, not to sow 'em.  
For goodness' sake, consider what you do;  
How you may hurt yourself, ay, utterly  
Grow from the king's acquaintance, by this carriage.  
The hearts of princes kiss obedience,  
So much they love it; but to stubborn spirits  
They swell, and grow as terrible as storms.  
I know you have a gentle, noble temper,  
A soul as even as a calm: pray, think us  
Those we profess, peace-makers, friends, and servants.

**CARDINAL CAMPEIUS**  
Madam, you'll find it so. You wrong your virtues  
With these weak women's fears: a noble spirit,  
As yours was put into you, ever casts  
Such doubts, as false coin, from it. The king loves you;  
Beware you lose it not: for us, if you please  
To trust us in your business, we are ready  
To use our utmost studies in your service.

**QUEEN KATHARINE**  
Do what ye will, my lords: and, pray, forgive me,  
If I have used myself unmannerly;  
You know I am a woman, lacking wit  
To make a seemly answer to such persons.  
Pray, do my service to his majesty:  
He has my heart yet; and shall have my prayers  
While I shall have my life. Come, reverend fathers,  
Bestow your counsels on me: she now begs,  
That little thought, when she set footing here,  
She should have bought her dignities so dear.

*Exeunt*

## INTERMISSION

### SCENE II. Ante-chamber to KING HENRY VIII's apartment.

*Enter NORFOLK, SUFFOLK, and Chamberlain*

**SUFFOLK**  
The cardinal!

*Enter CARDINAL WOLSEY and CROMWELL*

**NORFOLK**  
Observe, observe, he's moody. /

**CARDINAL WOLSEY**  
/ The packet, Cromwell.  
Gave't you the king? /

**CROMWELL**  
/ To his own hand, in's bedchamber.

**CARDINAL WOLSEY**  
Look'd he o' the inside of the paper? /

**CROMWELL**  
/ Presently  
He did unseal them: and the first he view'd,  
He did it with a serious mind; a heed  
Was in his countenance. You he bade  
Attend him here this morning. /

**CARDINAL WOLSEY**  
/ Is he ready  
To come abroad? /

**CROMWELL**  
/ I think, by this he is.

**CARDINAL WOLSEY**  
Leave me awhile.

*Exit CROMWELL*

*\[Aside]*  
It shall be to the Duchess of Alencon,  
The French king's sister: he shall marry her.  
Anne Bullen! No; I'll no Anne Bullens for him:  
There's more in't than fair visage. Bullen!  
No, we'll no Bullens. Speedily I wish  
To hear from Rome. The Marchioness of Pembroke!

**NORFOLK**  
He's discontented.

**SUFFOLK**  
May be, he hears the king  
Does whet his anger to him.

**NORFOLK**  
Sharp enough,  
Lord, for thy justice!

**CARDINAL WOLSEY**  
*\[Aside]*  
The late queen's gentlewoman, a knight's daughter,  
To be her mistress' mistress! the queen's queen!  
This candle burns not clear: 'tis I must snuff it;  
Then out it goes. What though I know her virtuous  
And well deserving? yet I know her for  
A spleeny Lutheran; and not wholesome to  
Our cause, that she should lie i' the bosom of  
Our hard-ruled king. Again, there is sprung up  
An heretic, an arch one, Cranmer; one  
Hath crawl'd into the favour of the king,  
And is his oracle. /

**NORFOLK**  
/ He is vex'd at something.

**SUFFOLK**  
I would 'twere something that would fret the string,  
The master-cord on's heart! /

*Enter KING HENRY VIII, reading of a schedule, and LOVELL*

/ The king, the king!

**KING HENRY VIII**  
What piles of wealth hath he accumulated  
To his own portion! and what expense by the hour  
Seems to flow from him! How, i' the name of thrift,  
Does he rake this together! Now, my lords,  
Saw you the cardinal? /

**NORFOLK**  
/ My lord, we have  
Stood here observing him: some strange commotion  
Is in his brain: he bites his lip, and starts;  
Stops on a sudden, looks upon the ground,  
Then lays his finger on his temple, straight  
Springs out into fast gait; then stops again,  
Strikes his breast hard, and anon he casts  
His eye against the moon: in most strange postures  
We have seen him set himself. /

**KING HENRY VIII**  
/ It may well be;  
There is a mutiny in's mind. This morning  
Papers of state he sent me to peruse,  
As I required: and wot you what I found  
There,--on my conscience, put unwittingly?  
Forsooth, an inventory, thus importing;  
The several parcels of his plate, his treasure,  
Rich stuffs, and ornaments of household; which  
I find at such proud rate, that it out-speaks  
Possession of a subject. /

**NORFOLK**  
/ It's heaven's will:  
Some spirit put this paper in the packet,  
To bless your eye withal. /

**KING HENRY VIII**  
/ If we did think  
His contemplation were above the earth,  
And fix'd on spiritual object, he should still  
Dwell in his musings: but I am afraid  
His thinkings are below the moon, not worth  
His serious considering. /

*King HENRY VIII takes his seat; whispers LOVELL, who goes
to CARDINAL WOLSEY*

**CARDINAL WOLSEY**  
/ Heaven forgive me!  
Ever God bless your highness! /

**KING HENRY VIII**  
/ Good my lord,  
You are full of heavenly stuff, and bear the inventory  
Of your best graces in your mind; the which  
You were now running o'er: you have scarce time  
To steal from spiritual leisure a brief span  
To keep your earthly audit: sure, in that  
I deem you an ill husband, and am glad  
To have you therein my companion. /

**CARDINAL WOLSEY**  
/ Sir,  
For holy offices I have a time; a time  
To think upon the part of business which  
I bear i' the state; and nature does require  
Her times of preservation, which perforce  
I, her frail son, amongst my brethren mortal,  
Must give my tendence to. /

**KING HENRY VIII**  
/ You have said well.

**CARDINAL WOLSEY**  
And ever may your highness yoke together,  
As I will lend you cause, my doing well  
With my well saying! /

**KING HENRY VIII**  
/ 'Tis well said again;  
And 'tis a kind of good deed to say well:  
And yet words are no deeds. My father loved you:  
His said he did; and with his deed did crown  
His word upon you. Since I had my office,  
I have kept you next my heart; have not alone  
Employ'd you where high profits might come home,  
But pared my present havings, to bestow  
My bounties upon you. /

**CARDINAL WOLSEY**  
*\[Aside]*  
/ What should this mean?

**SUFFOLK**  
*\[Aside]*  
The Lord increase this business! /

**KING HENRY VIII**  
/ Have I not made you,  
The prime man of the state? I pray you, tell me,  
If what I now pronounce you have found true:  
And, if you may confess it, say withal,  
If you are bound to us or no. What say you?

**CARDINAL WOLSEY**  
My sovereign, I confess your royal graces,  
Shower'd on me daily, have been more than could  
My studied purposes requite; which went  
Beyond all man's endeavours: my endeavours  
Have ever come too short of my desires,  
Yet filed with my abilities: mine own ends  
Have been mine so that evermore they pointed  
To the good of your most sacred person and  
The profit of the state. For your great graces  
Heap'd upon me, poor undeserver, I  
Can nothing render but allegiant thanks,  
My prayers to heaven for you, my loyalty,  
Which ever has and ever shall be growing,  
Till death, that winter, kill it. /

**KING HENRY VIII**  
/ Fairly answer'd;  
A loyal and obedient subject is  
Therein illustrated: the honour of it  
Does pay the act of it; as, i' the contrary,  
The foulness is the punishment. I presume  
That, as my hand has open'd bounty to you,  
My heart dropp'd love, my power rain'd honour, more  
On you than any; so your hand and heart,  
Your brain, and every function of your power,  
Should, notwithstanding that your bond of duty,  
As 'twere in love's particular, be more  
To me, your friend, than any. /

**CARDINAL WOLSEY**  
/ I do profess  
That for your highness' good I ever labour'd  
More than mine own; that am, have, and will be.

**KING HENRY VIII**  
Take notice, lords, he has a loyal breast,  
For you have seen him open't. Read o'er this;

*\[Giving him papers]*  
And after, this: and then to breakfast with  
What appetite you have. /

*Exit KING HENRY VIII, frowning upon CARDINAL WOLSEY: the
Nobles throng after him, smiling and whispering*

**CARDINAL WOLSEY**  
/ What should this mean?  
What sudden anger's this? how have I reap'd it?  
He parted frowning from me, as if ruin  
Leap'd from his eyes: so looks the chafed lion  
Upon the daring huntsman that has gall'd him;  
Then makes him nothing. I must read this paper;  
I fear, the story of his anger. 'Tis so;  
This paper has undone me: 'tis the account  
Of all that world of wealth I have drawn together  
For mine own ends; indeed, to gain the popedom,  
And fee my friends in Rome. O negligence!  
Fit for a fool to fall by: what cross devil  
Made me put this main secret in the packet  
I sent the king? Is there no way to cure this?  
No new device to beat this from his brains?  
I know 'twill stir him strongly; yet I know  
A way, if it take right, in spite of fortune  
Will bring me off again. What's this? 'To the Pope!'  
The letter, as I live, with all the business  
I writ to's holiness. Nay then, farewell!  
I have touch'd the highest point of all my greatness;  
And, from that full meridian of my glory,  
I haste now to my setting: I shall fall  
Like a bright exhalation in the evening,  
And no man see me more.  
Farewell! a long farewell, to all my greatness!  
This is the state of man: today he puts forth  
The tender leaves of hopes; tomorrow blossoms,  
And bears his blushing honours thick upon him;  
The third day comes a frost, a killing frost,  
And, when he thinks, good easy man, full surely  
His greatness is a-ripening, nips his root,  
And then he falls, as I do. I have ventured,  
Like little wanton boys that swim on bladders,  
This many summers in a sea of glory,  
But far beyond my depth: my high-blown pride  
At length broke under me and now has left me,  
Weary and old with service, to the mercy  
Of a rude stream, that must forever hide me.  
Vain pomp and glory of this world, I hate ye:  
I feel my heart new open'd. O, how wretched  
Is that poor man that hangs on princes' favours!  
There is, betwixt that smile we would aspire to,  
That sweet aspect of princes, and their ruin,  
More pangs and fears than wars or women have:  
And when he falls, he falls like Lucifer,  
Never to hope again. /

*Enter CROMWELL*

*\[Stands amazed]*  
/ Why, how now, Cromwell!

**CROMWELL**  
I have no power to speak, sir. /

**CARDINAL WOLSEY**  
/ What, amazed  
At my misfortunes? can thy spirit wonder  
A great man should decline? Nay, an you weep,  
I am fall'n indeed.

**CROMWELL**  
How does your grace? /

**CARDINAL WOLSEY**  
/ Why, well;  
Never so truly happy, my good Cromwell.  
I know myself now; and I feel within me  
A peace above all earthly dignities,  
A still and quiet conscience. The king has cured me,  
I humbly thank his grace; and from these shoulders,  
These ruin'd pillars, out of pity, taken  
A load would sink a navy, too much honour:  
O, 'tis a burthen, Cromwell, 'tis a burthen  
Too heavy for a man that hopes for heaven!

**CROMWELL**  
I am glad your grace has made that right use of it.

**CARDINAL WOLSEY**  
I hope I have: I am able now, methinks,  
Out of a fortitude of soul I feel,  
To endure more miseries and greater far  
Than my weak-hearted enemies dare offer.  
What news abroad? /

**CROMWELL**  
/ The heaviest and the worst  
Is your displeasure with the king. /

**CARDINAL WOLSEY**  
/ God bless him!

**CROMWELL**  
The next is, that Sir Thomas More is chosen  
Lord chancellor in your place. /

**CARDINAL WOLSEY**  
/ That's somewhat sudden:  
But he's a learned man. May he continue  
Long in his highness' favour, and do justice  
For truth's sake and his conscience; that his bones,  
When he has run his course and sleeps in blessings,  
May have a tomb of orphans' tears wept on em! What more?

**CROMWELL**  
That Cranmer is return'd with welcome,  
Install'd lord archbishop of Canterbury.

**CARDINAL WOLSEY**  
That's news indeed. /

**CROMWELL**  
/ Last, that the Lady Anne,  
Whom the king hath in secrecy long married,  
This day was view'd in open as his queen,  
Going to chapel; and the voice is now  
Only about her coronation.

**CARDINAL WOLSEY**  
There was the weight that pull'd me down. O Cromwell,  
The king has gone beyond me: all my glories  
In that one woman I have lost for ever:  
No sun shall ever usher forth mine honours,  
Or gild again the noble troops that waited  
Upon my smiles. Go, get thee from me, Cromwell;  
I am a poor fall'n man, unworthy now  
To be thy lord and master: seek the king;  
That sun, I pray, may never set! I have told him  
What and how true thou art: he will advance thee;  
Some little memory of me will stir him--  
I know his noble nature--not to let  
Thy hopeful service perish too: good Cromwell,  
Neglect him not; make use now, and provide  
For thine own future safety. /

**CROMWELL**  
/ O my lord,  
Must I, then, leave you? must I needs forego  
So good, so noble and so true a master?  
Bear witness, all that have not hearts of iron,  
With what a sorrow Cromwell leaves his lord.  
The king shall have my service: but my prayers  
Forever and forever shall be yours.

**CARDINAL WOLSEY**  
Cromwell, I did not think to shed a tear  
In all my miseries; but thou hast forced me,  
Out of thy honest truth, to play the woman.  
Let's dry our eyes: and thus far hear me, Cromwell;  
And, when I am forgotten, as I shall be,  
And sleep in dull cold marble, where no mention  
Of me more must be heard of, say, I taught thee,  
Say, Wolsey, that once trod the ways of glory,  
And sounded all the depths and shoals of honour,  
Found thee a way, out of his wreck, to rise in;  
A sure and safe one, though thy master miss'd it.  
Mark but my fall, and that that ruin'd me.  
Cromwell, I charge thee, fling away ambition:  
By that sin fell the angels; how can man, then,  
The image of his Maker, hope to win by it?  
Love thyself last: cherish those hearts that hate thee;  
Corruption wins not more than honesty.  
Still in thy right hand carry gentle peace,  
To silence envious tongues. Be just, and fear not:  
Let all the ends thou aim'st at be thy country's,  
Thy God's, and truth's; then if thou fall'st, O Cromwell,  
Thou fall'st a blessed martyr! Serve the king;  
And,--prithee, lead me in:  
There take an inventory of all I have,  
To the last penny; 'tis the king's: my robe,  
And my integrity to heaven, is all  
I dare now call mine own. O Cromwell, Cromwell!  
Had I but served my God with half the zeal  
I served my king, he would not in mine age  
Have left me naked to mine enemies.

**CROMWELL**  
Good sir, have patience. /

**CARDINAL WOLSEY**  
/ So I have. Farewell  
The hopes of court! my hopes in heaven do dwell.

*Exeunt*

## ACT IV

### SCENE II. Kimbolton.

*Enter KATHARINE, Dowager, sick; led between GRIFFITH, her
gentleman usher, and PATIENCE, her woman*

**GRIFFITH**  
How does your grace? /

**KATHARINE**  
/ O Griffith, sick to death!  
My legs, like loaden branches, bow to the earth,  
Willing to leave their burthen. Reach a chair:  
So; now, methinks, I feel a little ease.  
Didst thou not tell me, Griffith, as thou led'st me,  
That the great child of honour, Cardinal Wolsey,  
Was dead? /

**GRIFFITH**  
/ Yes, madam; but I think your grace,  
Out of the pain you suffer'd, gave no ear to't.

**KATHARINE**  
Prithee, good Griffith, tell me how he died:  
If well, he stepp'd before me, happily  
For my example. /

**GRIFFITH**  
/ Well, the voice goes, madam:  
For after the stout Earl Northumberland  
Arrested him at York, and brought him forward,  
As a man sorely tainted, to his answer,  
He fell sick suddenly, and grew so ill  
He could not sit his mule. /

**KATHARINE**  
/ Alas, poor man!

**GRIFFITH**  
At last, with easy roads, he came to Leicester,  
Lodged in the abbey; where the reverend abbot,  
With all his covent, honourably received him;  
To whom he gave these words, 'O, father abbot,  
An old man, broken with the storms of state,  
Is come to lay his weary bones among ye;  
Give him a little earth for charity!'  
So went to bed; where eagerly his sickness  
Pursued him still: and, three nights after this,  
About the hour of eight, which he himself  
Foretold should be his last, full of repentance,  
Continual meditations, tears, and sorrows,  
He gave his honours to the world again,  
His blessed part to heaven, and slept in peace.

**KATHARINE**  
So may he rest; his faults lie gently on him!  
Yet thus far, Griffith, give me leave to speak him,  
And yet with charity. He was a man  
Of an unbounded stomach, ever ranking  
Himself with princes; one that, by suggestion,  
Tied all the kingdom: simony was fair-play;  
His own opinion was his law: i' the presence  
He would say untruths; and be ever double  
Both in his words and meaning: he was never,  
But where he meant to ruin, pitiful:  
His promises were, as he then was, mighty;  
But his performance, as he is now, nothing:  
Of his own body he was ill, and gave  
The clergy in example. /

**GRIFFITH**  
/ Noble madam,  
Men's evil manners live in brass; their virtues  
We write in water. May it please your highness  
To hear me speak his good now? /

**KATHARINE**  
/ Yes, good Griffith;  
I were malicious else. /

**GRIFFITH**  
/ This cardinal,  
Though from an humble stock, undoubtedly  
Was fashion'd to much honour from his cradle.  
He was a scholar, and a ripe and good one;  
Exceeding wise, fair-spoken, and persuading:  
Lofty and sour to them that loved him not;  
But to those men that sought him sweet as summer.  
And though he were unsatisfied in getting,  
Which was a sin, yet in bestowing, madam,  
He was most princely: ever witness for him  
Those twins of learning that he raised in you,  
Ipswich and Oxford! one of which fell with him,  
Unwilling to outlive the good that did it;  
The other, though unfinish'd, yet so famous,  
So excellent in art, and still so rising,  
That Christendom shall ever speak his virtue.  
His overthrow heap'd happiness upon him;  
For then, and not till then, he felt himself,  
And found the blessedness of being little:  
And, to add greater honours to his age  
Than man could give him, he died fearing God.

**KATHARINE**  
After my death I wish no other herald,  
No other speaker of my living actions,  
To keep mine honour from corruption,  
But such an honest chronicler as Griffith.  
Whom I most hated living, thou hast made me,  
With thy religious truth and modesty,  
Now in his ashes honour: peace be with him!  
Patience, be near me still; and set me lower:  
I have not long to trouble thee. Good Griffith,  
Cause the musicians play me that sad note  
I named my knell, whilst I sit meditating  
On that celestial harmony I go to.

*Sad and solemn music*

**GRIFFITH**  
She is asleep: good wench, let's sit down quiet,  
For fear we wake her: softly, gentle Patience.

*The music continues*

**KATHARINE**  
Spirits of peace, where are ye? are ye all gone,  
And leave me here in wretchedness behind ye?

**GRIFFITH**  
Madam, we are here. /

**KATHARINE**  
/ It is not you I call for:  
Saw ye none enter since I slept? /

**GRIFFITH**  
/ None, madam.

**KATHARINE**  
No? Saw you not, even now, a blessed troop  
Invite me to a banquet; whose bright faces  
Cast thousand beams upon me, like the sun?  
They promised me eternal happiness;  
And brought me garlands, Griffith, which I feel  
I am not worthy yet to wear: I shall, assuredly.

**GRIFFITH**  
I am most joyful, madam, such good dreams  
Possess your fancy. /

**KATHARINE**  
/ Bid the music leave,  
They are harsh and heavy to me. /

*Music ceases*

**PATIENCE**  
Do you note
How much her grace is alter'd on the sudden?  
How long her face is drawn? how pale she looks,  
And of an earthy cold? Mark her eyes!

**GRIFFITH**  
She is going, wench: pray, pray.

**PATIENCE**  
Heaven comfort her!

*Enter CAPUCIUS*

**KATHARINE**  
/ If my sight fail not,  
You should be lord ambassador from the emperor,  
My royal nephew, and your name Capucius.

**CAPUCIUS**  
Madam, the same; your servant. /

**KATHARINE**  
/ O, my lord,  
The times and titles now are alter'd strangely  
With me since first you knew me. But, I pray you,  
What is your pleasure with me? /

**CAPUCIUS**  
/ Noble lady,  
First mine own service to your grace; the next,  
The king's request that I would visit you;  
Who grieves much for your weakness, and by me  
Sends you his princely commendations,  
And heartily entreats you take good comfort.

**KATHARINE**  
O my good lord, that comfort comes too late;  
'Tis like a pardon after execution:  
That gentle physic, given in time, had cured me;  
But now I am past all comforts here, but prayers.  
How does his highness? /

**CAPUCIUS**  
/ Madam, in good health.

**KATHARINE**  
So may he ever do! and ever flourish,  
When I shall l dwell with worms, and my poor name  
Banish'd the kingdom! Patience, is that letter,  
I caused you write, yet sent away? /

**PATIENCE**  
*\[Giving it to KATHARINE]*  
/ No, madam.

**KATHARINE**  
Sir, I most humbly pray you to deliver  
This to my lord the king. /

**CAPUCIUS**  
/ Most willing, madam.

**KATHARINE**  
In which I have commended to his goodness  
The model of our chaste loves, his young daughter;  
The dews of heaven fall thick in blessings on her!  
Beseeching him to give her virtuous breeding--  
She is young, and of a noble modest nature,  
I hope she will deserve well,--and a little  
To love her for her mother's sake, that loved him,  
Heaven knows how dearly. My next poor petition  
Is, that his noble grace would have some pity  
Upon my wretched women, that so long  
Have follow'd both my fortunes faithfully:  
Of which there is not one, I dare avow,  
And now I should not lie, but will deserve  
For virtue and true beauty of the soul,  
For honesty and decent carriage,  
A right good husband, let him be a noble  
And, sure, those men are happy that shall have 'em.  
The last is, for my men; they are the poorest,  
But poverty could never draw 'em from me;  
That they may have their wages duly paid 'em,  
And something over to remember me by:  
If heaven had pleased to have given me longer life  
And able means, we had not parted thus.  
These are the whole contents: and, good my lord,  
By that you love the dearest in this world,  
As you wish Christian peace to souls departed,  
Stand these poor people's friend, and urge the king  
To do me this last right. /

**CAPUCIUS**  
/ By heaven, I will,  
Or let me lose the fashion of a man!

**KATHARINE**  
I thank you, honest lord. Remember me  
In all humility unto his highness:  
Say his long trouble now is passing  
Out of this world; tell him, in death I bless'd him,  
For so I will. Mine eyes grow dim. Farewell,  
My lord. Griffith, farewell. Nay, Patience,  
You must not leave me yet: I must to bed;  
Call in more women. When I am dead, good wench,  
Let me be used with honour: strew me over  
With maiden flowers, that all the world may know  
I was a chaste wife to my grave: embalm me,  
Then lay me forth: although unqueen'd, yet like  
A queen, and daughter to a king, inter me.  
I can no more.

*Exeunt, leading KATHARINE*

## ACT V

### SCENE I. London. A gallery in the palace.

*Enter GARDINER, Bishop of Winchester, met by LOVELL*

**GARDINER**  
These should be hours for necessities,  
Not for delights; times to repair our nature  
With comforting repose, and not for us  
To waste these times. Good hour of night, my lord!  
Whither so late? /

**LOVELL**  
/ Came you from the king, my lord.

**GARDINER**  
I did, my lord: and left him at primero  
With the Duke of Suffolk. /

**LOVELL**  
/ I must to him too,  
Before he go to bed. I'll take my leave.

**GARDINER**  
Not yet, my lord Lovell. What's the matter?  
It seems you are in haste: an if there be  
No great offence belongs to't, give your friend  
Some touch of your late business: affairs, that walk,  
As they say spirits do, at midnight, have  
In them a wilder nature than the business  
That seeks dispatch by day. /

**LOVELL**  
/ My lord, I love you;  
And durst commend a secret to your ear  
Much weightier than this work. The queen's in labour,  
They say, in great extremity; and fear'd  
She'll with the labour end. /

**GARDINER**  
/ The fruit she goes with  
I pray for heartily, that it may find  
Good time, and live: but for the stock, my lord,  
I wish it grubb'd up now. /

**LOVELL**  
/ Methinks I could  
Cry the amen; and yet my conscience says  
She's a good creature, and, sweet lady, does  
Deserve our better wishes. /

**GARDINER**  
/ But, good sir,  
Hear me, my lord: you're a gentle soul  
Of mine own way; I know you wise, religious;  
And, let me tell you, it will ne'er be well,  
'Twill not, my lord Lovell, take't of me,  
Till Cranmer, Cromwell, her two hands, and she,  
Sleep in their graves. /

**LOVELL**  
/ Now, sir, you speak of two  
The most remark'd i' the kingdom. As for Cromwell,  
Beside that of the jewel house, is made master  
O' the rolls, and the king's secretary; further, sir,  
Stands in the gap and trade of moe preferments,  
With which the time will load him. The archbishop  
Is the king's hand and tongue; and who dare speak  
One syllable against him? /

**GARDINER**  
/ Yes, yes, my lord,  
There are that dare; and I myself have ventured  
To speak my mind of him: and indeed this day,  
as I may tell it you, I think I have  
Incensed the lords o' the council, that he is,  
For so I know he is, they know he is,  
A most arch heretic, a pestilence  
That does infect the land: with which they moved  
Have broken with the king; who hath so far  
Given ear to our complaint, of his great grace  
And princely care foreseeing those fell mischiefs  
Our reasons laid before him, hath commanded  
Tomorrow morning to the council-board  
He be convented. He's a rank weed, my lord,  
And we must root him out. From your affairs  
I hinder you too long: good night, my lord.

**LOVELL**  
Many good nights, my lord: I rest your servant.

*Exeunt GARDINER*

*Enter KING HENRY VIII and SUFFOLK*

**KING HENRY VIII**  
Charles, I will play no more tonight;  
My mind's not on't; you are too hard for me.

**SUFFOLK**  
Sir, I did never win of you before.

**KING HENRY VIII**  
But little, Charles;  
Nor shall not, when my fancy's on my play.  
Now, Lovell, from the queen what is the news?

**LOVELL**  
I could not personally deliver to her  
What you commanded me, but by her woman  
I sent your message; who return'd her thanks  
In the great'st humbleness, and desired your highness  
Most heartily to pray for her. /

**KING HENRY VIII**  
/ What say'st thou, ha?  
To pray for her? what, is she crying out?

**LOVELL**  
So said her woman; and that her sufferance made  
Almost each pang a death. /

**KING HENRY VIII**  
/ Alas, good lady!

**SUFFOLK**  
God safely quit her of her burthen, and  
With gentle travail, to the gladding of  
Your highness with an heir! /

**KING HENRY VIII**  
/ 'Tis midnight, Charles;  
Prithee, to bed; and in thy prayers remember  
The estate of my poor queen. Leave me alone;  
For I must think of that which company  
Would not be friendly to. /

**SUFFOLK**  
/ I wish your highness  
A quiet night; and my good mistress will  
Remember in my prayers. /

**KING HENRY VIII**  
/ Charles, good night.

*Exit SUFFOLK*

*Enter CRANMER*

**KING HENRY VIII**  
Avoid the gallery. /

*LOVELL seems to stay*

/ Ha! I have said. Be gone. What!

*Exeunt LOVELL*

**CRANMER**  
*\[Aside]*  
I am fearful: wherefore frowns he thus?  
'Tis his aspect of terror. All's not well.

**KING HENRY VIII**  
How now, my lord! you desire to know  
Wherefore I sent for you. /

**CRANMER**  
*\[Kneeling]*  
/ It is my duty  
To attend your highness' pleasure. /

**KING HENRY VIII**  
/ Pray you, arise,  
My good and gracious Lord of Canterbury.  
Come, you and I must walk a turn together;  
I have news to tell you: come, come, give me your hand.  
Ah, my good lord, I grieve at what I speak,  
And am right sorry to repeat what follows  
I have, and most unwillingly, of late  
Heard many grievous, I do say, my lord,  
Grievous complaints of you; which, being consider'd,  
Have moved us and our council, that you shall  
This morning come before us; where, I know,  
You cannot with such freedom purge yourself,  
But that, till further trial in those charges  
Which will require your answer, you must take  
Your patience to you, and be well contented  
To make your house our Tower: you a brother of us,  
It fits we thus proceed, or else no witness  
Would come against you. /

**CRANMER**  
*\[Kneeling]*  
/ I humbly thank your highness;  
And am right glad to catch this good occasion  
Most throughly to be winnow'd, where my chaff  
And corn shall fly asunder: for, I know,  
There's none stands under more calumnious tongues  
Than I myself, poor man. /

**KING HENRY VIII**  
/ Stand up, good Canterbury:  
Thy truth and thy integrity is rooted  
In us, thy friend: give me thy hand, stand up:  
Prithee, let's walk. Now, by my holidame.  
What manner of man are you? My lord, I look'd  
You would have given me your petition, that  
I should have ta'en some pains to bring together  
Yourself and your accusers; and to have heard you,  
Without indurance, further. /

**CRANMER**  
/ Most dread liege,  
The good I stand on is my truth and honesty:  
If they shall fail, I, with mine enemies,  
Will triumph o'er my person; which I weigh not,  
Being of those virtues vacant. I fear nothing  
What can be said against me. /

**KING HENRY VIII**  
/ Know you not  
How your state stands i' the world, with the whole world?  
Your enemies are many, and not small; their practises  
Must bear the same proportion; and not ever  
The justice and the truth o' the question carries  
The due o' the verdict with it: at what ease  
Might corrupt minds procure knaves as corrupt  
To swear against you? such things have been done.  
You are potently opposed; and with a malice  
Of as great size. Ween you of better luck,  
I mean, in perjured witness, than your master,  
Whose minister you are, whiles here he lived  
Upon this naughty earth? Go to, go to;  
You take a precipice for no leap of danger,  
And woo your own destruction. /

**CRANMER**  
/ God and your majesty  
Protect mine innocence, or I fall into  
The trap is laid for me! /

**KING HENRY VIII**  
/ Be of good cheer;  
They shall no more prevail than we give way to.  
Keep comfort to you; and this morning see  
You do appear before them: if they shall chance,  
In charging you with matters, to commit you,  
The best persuasions to the contrary  
Fail not to use, and with what vehemency  
The occasion shall instruct you: if entreaties  
Will render you no remedy, this ring  
Deliver them, and your appeal to us  
There make before them. Look, the good man weeps!  
He's honest, on mine honour. God's blest mother!  
I swear he is true--hearted; and a soul  
None better in my kingdom. Get you gone,  
And do as I have bid you. /

*Exit CRANMER*

/ He has strangled  
His language in his tears. /

*Enter Old Lady, LOVELL following*

**LOVELL**  
*\[Within]*  
/ Come back: what mean you?

**Old Lady**  
I'll not come back; the tidings that I bring  
Will make my boldness manners. Now, good angels  
Fly o'er thy royal head, and shade thy person  
Under their blessed wings! /

**KING HENRY VIII**  
/ Now, by thy looks  
I guess thy message. Is the queen deliver'd?  
Say, ay; and of a boy. /

**Old Lady**  
/ Ay, ay, my liege;  
And of a lovely boy: the God of heaven  
Both now and ever bless her! 'tis a girl,  
Promises boys hereafter. Sir, your queen  
Desires your visitation, and to be  
Acquainted with this stranger 'tis as like you  
As cherry is to cherry. /

**KING HENRY VIII**  
/ Lovell! /

**LOVELL**  
/ Sir?

**KING HENRY VIII**  
Give her an hundred marks. I'll to the queen.

*Exit*

**Old Lady**  
An hundred marks! By this light, I'll ha' more.  
An ordinary groom is for such payment.  
I will have more, or scold it out of him.  
Said I for this, the girl was like to him?  
I will have more, or else unsay't; and now,  
While it is hot, I'll put it to the issue.

*Exeunt*

### SCENE III. The Council-Chamber.

*Enter Chancellor; places himself at the upper end of the
table on the left hand; a seat being left void above him,
as for CRANMER's seat. SUFFOLK, NORFOLK, Chamberlain,
GARDINER, seat themselves in order on each side. CROMWELL
at lower end, as secretary. The Keeper at the door.*

**Chancellor**  
Speak to the business, master-secretary:  
Why are we met in council? /

**CROMWELL**  
/ Please your honours,  
The chief cause concerns his grace of Canterbury.

**GARDINER**  
Has he had knowledge of it? /

**CROMWELL**  
/ Yes. /

**NORFOLK**  
/ Who waits there?

**Keeper**  
Without, my noble lords? /

**GARDINER**  
/ Yes. /

**Keeper**  
/ My lord archbishop;  
And has done half an hour, to know your pleasures.

**Chancellor**  
Let him come in. /

**Keeper**  
/ Your grace may enter now.

*CRANMER enters and approaches the council-table*

**Chancellor**  
My good lord archbishop, I'm very sorry  
To sit here at this present, and behold  
That chair stand empty: but we all are men,  
In our own natures frail, and capable  
Of our flesh; few are angels: out of which frailty  
And want of wisdom, you, that best should teach us,  
Have misdemean'd yourself, and not a little,  
Toward the king first, then his laws, in filling  
The whole realm, by your teaching and your chaplains,  
For so we are inform'd, with new opinions,  
Divers and dangerous; which are heresies,  
And, not reform'd, may prove pernicious.

**GARDINER**  
Which reformation must be sudden too,  
My noble lords; for those that tame wild horses  
Pace 'em not in their hands to make 'em gentle,  
But stop their mouths with stubborn bits, and spur 'em,  
Till they obey the manage. If we suffer,  
Out of our easiness and childish pity  
To one man's honour, this contagious sickness,  
Farewell all physic: and what follows then?  
Commotions, uproars, with a general taint  
Of the whole state: as, of late days, our neighbours,  
The upper Germany, can dearly witness,  
Yet freshly pitied in our memories.

**CRANMER**  
My good lords, hitherto, in all the progress  
Both of my life and office, I have labour'd,  
And with no little study, that my teaching  
And the strong course of my authority  
Might go one way, and safely; and the end  
Was ever, to do well: nor is there living,  
I speak it with a single heart, my lords,  
A man that more detests, more stirs against,  
Both in his private conscience and his place,  
Defacers of a public peace, than I do.  
Pray heaven, the king may never find a heart  
With less allegiance in it! Men that make  
Envy and crooked malice nourishment  
Dare bite the best. I do beseech your lordships,  
That, in this case of justice, my accusers,  
Be what they will, may stand forth face to face,  
And freely urge against me. /

**SUFFOLK**  
/ Nay, my lord,  
That cannot be: you are a counsellor,  
And, by that virtue, no man dare accuse you.

**GARDINER**  
My lord, because we have business of more moment,  
We will be short with you. 'Tis his highness' pleasure,  
And our consent, for better trial of you,  
From hence you be committed to the Tower;  
Where, being but a private man again,  
You shall know many dare accuse you boldly,  
More than, I fear, you are provided for.

**CRANMER**  
Ah, my good Lord of Winchester, I thank you;  
You are always my good friend; if your will pass,  
I shall both find your lordship judge and juror,  
You are so merciful: I see your end;  
'Tis my undoing: love and meekness, lord,  
Become a churchman better than ambition:  
Win straying souls with modesty again,  
Cast none away. That I shall clear myself,  
Lay all the weight ye can upon my patience,  
I make as little doubt, as you do conscience  
In doing daily wrongs. I could say more,  
But reverence to your calling makes me modest.

**GARDINER**  
My lord, my lord, you are a sectary,  
That's the plain truth: your painted gloss discovers,  
To men that understand you, words and weakness.

**CROMWELL**  
My Lord of Winchester, you are a little,  
By your good favour, too sharp; men so noble,  
However faulty, yet should find respect  
For what they have been: 'tis a cruelty  
To load a falling man. /

**GARDINER**  
/ Good master secretary,  
I cry your honour mercy; you may, worst  
Of all this table, say so. /

**CROMWELL**  
/ Why, my lord?

**GARDINER**  
Do not I know you for a favourer  
Of this new sect? ye are not sound. /

**CROMWELL**  
/ Not sound?

**GARDINER**  
Not sound, I say. /

**CROMWELL**  
/ Would you were half so honest!  
Men's prayers then would seek you, not their fears.

**GARDINER**  
I shall remember this bold language. /

**CROMWELL**  
/ Do.
Remember your bold life too. /

**Chancellor**  
/ This is too much;  
Forbear, for shame, my lords. /

**GARDINER**  
/ I have done. /

**CROMWELL**  
/ And I.

**Chancellor**  
Then thus for you, my lord: it stands agreed,  
I take it, by all voices, that forthwith  
You be convey'd to the Tower a prisoner;  
There to remain till the king's further pleasure  
Be known unto us: are you all agreed, lords?

**All**  
We are. /

**CRANMER**  
/ Is there no other way of mercy,  
But I must needs t' th' Tower, my lords? /

**GARDINER**  
/ What other
Would you expect? you are strangely troublesome.  
Let one o' the guard be ready there. /

*Enter Guard*

**CRANMER**  
/ For me?
Must I go like a traitor thither? /

**GARDINER**  
/ Receive him,
And see him safe i' the Tower. /

**CRANMER**  
/ Stay, good my lords,  
I have a little yet to say. Look there, my lords;  
By virtue of that ring, I take my cause  
Out of the gripes of cruel men, and give it  
To a most noble judge, the king my master.

**Chamberlain**  
This is the king's ring. /

**NORFOLK**  
/ 'Tis no counterfeit.

**SUFFOLK**  
'Tis the right ring, by heaven: I told ye all,  
When ye first put this dangerous stone a-rolling,  
'Twould fall upon ourselves. /

**NORFOLK**  
/ Do you think, my lords,  
The king will suffer but the little finger  
Of this man to be vex'd? /

**Chancellor**  
/ 'Tis now too certain:  
How much more is his life in value with him?  
Would I were fairly out on't! /

**CROMWELL**  
/ My mind gave me,  
In seeking tales and informations  
Against this man, whose honesty the devil  
And his disciples only envy at,  
Ye blew the fire that burns ye: now have at ye!

*Enter KING, frowning on them; takes his seat*

**GARDINER**  
Dread sovereign, how much are we bound to heaven  
In daily thanks, that gave us such a prince;  
Not only good and wise, but most religious:  
One that, in all obedience, makes the church  
The chief aim of his honour; and, to strengthen  
That holy duty, out of dear respect,  
His royal self in judgment comes to hear  
The cause betwixt her and this great offender.

**KING HENRY VIII**  
You were ever good at sudden commendations,  
Bishop of Winchester. But know, I come not  
To hear such flattery now, and in my presence;  
They are too thin and bare to hide offences.  
To me you cannot reach, you play the spaniel,  
And think with wagging of your tongue to win me;  
But, whatsoe'er thou takest me for, I'm sure  
Thou hast a cruel nature and a bloody.

*\[To CRANMER]*  
Good man, sit down. Now let me see the proudest  
He, that dares most, but wag his finger at thee:  
By all that's holy, he had better starve  
Than but once think this place becomes thee not.

**GARDINER**  
May 't please your grace,-- /

**KING HENRY VIII**  
/ No, sir, it does not please me.  
I had thought I had had men of some understanding  
And wisdom of my council; but I find none.  
Was it discretion, lords, to let this man,  
This good man,--few of you deserve that title,--  
This honest man, wait like a lousy footboy  
At chamber-door? and one as great as you are?  
Why, what a shame was this! Did my commission  
Bid ye so far forget yourselves? I gave ye  
Power as he was a counsellor to try him,  
Not as a groom: there's some of ye, I see,  
More out of malice than integrity,  
Would try him to the utmost, had ye mean;  
Which ye shall never have while I live. /

**Chancellor**  
/ Thus far,
My most dread sovereign, may it like your grace  
To let my tongue excuse all. What was purposed  
Concerning his imprisonment, was rather,  
If there be faith in men, meant for his trial,  
And fair purgation to the world, than malice,  
I'm sure, in me. /

**KING HENRY VIII**  
/ Well, well, my lords, respect him;  
Take him, and use him well, he's worthy of it.  
I will say thus much for him, if a prince  
May be beholding to a subject, I  
Am, for his love and service, so to him.  
Make me no more ado, but all embrace him:  
Be friends, for shame, my lords! My Lord of Canterbury,  
I have a suit which you must not deny me;  
That is, a fair young maid that yet wants baptism,  
You must be godfather, and answer for her.

**CRANMER**  
The greatest monarch now alive may glory  
In such an honour: how may I deserve it  
That am a poor and humble subject to you?

**KING HENRY VIII**  
Come, come, my lord, you'd spare your spoons. You shall have  
Two noble partners with you, the old Duchess of Norfolk  
And Lady Marquess Dorset. Will these please you?  
Once more, my Lord of Winchester, I charge you,  
Embrace and love this man. /

**GARDINER**  
/ With a true heart  
And brother-love I do it. /

**CRANMER**  
/ And let heaven  
Witness, how dear I hold this confirmation.

**KING HENRY VIII**  
Good man, those joyful tears show thy true heart:  
The common voice, I see, is verified  
Of thee, which says thus, 'Do my Lord of Canterbury  
A shrewd turn, and he is your friend forever.'  
Come, lords, we trifle time away; I long  
To have this young one made a Christian.  
As I have made ye one, lords, one remain;  
So I grow stronger, you more honour gain.

*Exeunt*

### SCENE IV. The palace yard.

*Noise and tumult within. Enter Porter and his Man*

**Porter**  
You'll leave your noise anon, ye rascals: do you  
take the court for Paris-garden? ye rude slaves,  
leave your gaping.

**Gentleman**  
*\[Within]*  
Good master porter, I belong to the larder.

**Porter**  
Belong to the gallows, and be hanged, ye rogue! is  
this a place to roar in? Fetch me a dozen crab-tree  
staves, and strong ones: these are but switches to  
'em. I'll scratch your heads: you must be seeing  
christenings? do you look for ale and cakes here,  
you rude rascals?

**Man**  
Pray, sir, be patient: 'tis as much impossible--  
Unless we sweep 'em from the door with cannons--  
To scatter 'em, as 'tis to make 'em sleep  
On May-day morning; which will never be:  
We may as well push against Powle's, as stir em.

**Porter**  
How got they in, and be hang'd?

**Man**  
Alas, I know not; how gets the tide in?  
As much as one sound cudgel of four foot--  
You see the poor remainder--could distribute,  
I made no spare, sir. /

**Porter**  
/ You did nothing, sir.

**Man**  
I am not Samson, nor Sir Guy, nor Colbrand,  
To mow 'em down before me: but if I spared any  
That had a head to hit, either young or old,  
He or she, cuckold or cuckold-maker,  
Let me ne'er hope to see a chine again  
And that I would not for a cow, God save her!

**Gentleman**  
*\[Within]*  
Do you hear, master porter?

**Porter**  
I shall be with you presently, good master puppy.  
Keep the door close, sirrah.

**Man**  
What would you have me do?

**Porter**  
What should you do, but knock 'em down by the  
dozens? Is this Moorfields to muster in? or have  
we some strange Indian with the great tool come to  
court, the women so besiege us? Bless me, what a  
fry of fornication is at door! On my Christian  
conscience, this one christening will beget a  
thousand; here will be father, godfather, and all together.

**Man**  
The spoons will be the bigger, sir. There is a  
fellow somewhat near the door, he should be a  
brazier by his face, for, o' my conscience, twenty  
of the dog-days now reign in's nose; all that stand  
about him are under the line, they need no other  
penance: that fire-drake did I hit three times on  
the head, and three times was his nose discharged  
against me; he stands there, like a mortar-piece, to  
blow us. There was a haberdasher's wife of small  
wit near him, that railed upon me till her pinked  
porringer fell off her head, for kindling such a  
combustion in the state. I missed the meteor once,  
and hit that woman; who cried out 'Clubs!' when I  
might see from far some forty truncheoners draw to  
her succor, which were the hope o' the Strand, where  
she was quartered. They fell on; I made good my  
place: at length they came to the broom-staff to  
me; I defied 'em still: when suddenly a file of  
boys behind 'em, loose shot, delivered such a shower  
of pebbles, that I was fain to draw mine honour in,  
and let 'em win the work: the devil was amongst  
'em, I think, surely.

**Porter**  
These are the youths that thunder at a playhouse,  
and fight for bitten apples; that no audience, but  
the tribulation of Tower-hill, or the limbs of  
Limehouse, their dear brothers, are able to endure.  
I have some of 'em in Limbo Patrum, and there they  
are like to dance these three days; besides the  
running banquet of two beadles that is to come.

*Enter Chamberlain*

**Chamberlain**  
Mercy o' me, what a multitude are here!  
They grow still too; from all parts they are coming,  
As if we kept a fair here! Where are these porters,  
These lazy knaves? Ye have made a fine hand, fellows:  
There's a trim rabble let in: are all these  
Your faithful friends o' the suburbs? We shall have  
Great store of room, no doubt, left for the ladies,  
When they pass back from the christening.

**Porter**  
An't please your honour,  
We are but men; and what so many may do,  
Not being torn a-pieces, we have done:  
An army cannot rule 'em. /

**Chamberlain**  
/ As I live,
If the king blame me for't, I'll lay ye all  
By the heels, and suddenly; and on your heads  
Clap round fines for neglect: ye are lazy knaves;  
And here ye lie baiting of bombards, when  
Ye should do service. Hark! the trumpets sound;  
They're come already from the christening:  
Go, break among the press, and find a way out  
To let the troop pass fairly; or I'll find  
A Marshalsea shall hold ye play these two months.

**Porter**  
Make way there for the princess. /

**Man**  
/ You great fellow,  
Stand close up, or I'll make your head ache.

**Porter**  
You i' the camlet, get up o' the rail;  
I'll peck you o'er the pales else.

*Exeunt*

### SCENE V. The palace.

*Trumpets, sounding; Enter Garter, CRANMER, NORFOLK with
his marshal's staff, SUFFOLK, then the Duchess of Norfolk
bearing the child. The troop pass once about the stage,
and Garter speaks*

**Garter**  
Heaven, from thy endless goodness, send prosperous  
life, long, and ever happy, to the high and mighty  
princess of England, Elizabeth!

*Flourish. Enter KING HENRY VIII and Guard*

**CRANMER**  
*\[Kneeling]*  
And to your royal grace, and the good queen,  
My noble partners, and myself, thus pray:  
All comfort, joy, in this most gracious lady,  
Heaven ever laid up to make parents happy,  
May hourly fall upon ye! /

**KING HENRY VIII**  
/ Thank you, good lord archbishop:  
What is her name? /

**CRANMER**  
/ Elizabeth. /

**KING HENRY VIII**  
/ Stand up, lord.

*KING HENRY VIII kisses the child*

With this kiss take my blessing: God protect thee!  
Into whose hand I give thy life. /

**CRANMER**  
/ Amen.

**KING HENRY VIII**  
My noble gossips, ye have been too prodigal:  
I thank ye heartily; so shall this lady,  
When she has so much English. /

**CRANMER**  
/ Let me speak, sir,  
For heaven now bids me; and the words I utter  
Let none think flattery, for they'll find 'em truth.  
This royal infant--heaven still move about her!--  
Though in her cradle, yet now promises  
Upon this land a thousand thousand blessings,  
Which time shall bring to ripeness: she shall be--  
But few now living can behold that goodness--  
A pattern to all princes living with her,  
And all that shall succeed: Saba was never  
More covetous of wisdom and fair virtue  
Than this pure soul shall be: all princely graces,  
That mould up such a mighty piece as this is,  
With all the virtues that attend the good,  
Shall still be doubled on her: truth shall nurse her,  
Holy and heavenly thoughts still counsel her:  
She shall be loved and fear'd: her own shall bless her;  
Her foes shake like a field of beaten corn,  
And hang their heads with sorrow: good grows with her:  
In her days every man shall eat in safety,  
Under his own vine, what he plants; and sing  
The merry songs of peace to all his neighbours:  
God shall be truly known; and those about her  
From her shall read the perfect ways of honour,  
And by those claim their greatness, not by blood.  
Nor shall this peace sleep with her: but as when  
The bird of wonder dies, the maiden phoenix,  
Her ashes new create another heir,  
As great in admiration as herself;  
So shall she leave her blessedness to one,  
When heaven shall call her from this cloud of darkness,  
Who from the sacred ashes of her honour  
Shall star-like rise, as great in fame as she was,  
And so stand fix'd: peace, plenty, love, truth, terror,  
That were the servants to this chosen infant,  
Shall then be his, and like a vine grow to him:  
Wherever the bright sun of heaven shall shine,  
His honour and the greatness of his name  
Shall be, and make new nations: he shall flourish,  
And, like a mountain cedar, reach his branches  
To all the plains about him: our children's children  
Shall see this, and bless heaven. /

**KING HENRY VIII**  
/ Thou speakest wonders.

**CRANMER**  
She shall be, to the happiness of England,  
An aged princess; many days shall see her,  
And yet no day without a deed to crown it.  
Would I had known no more! but she must die,  
She must, the saints must have her; yet a virgin,  
A most unspotted lily shall she pass  
To the ground, and all the world shall mourn her.

**KING HENRY VIII**  
O lord archbishop,
Thou hast made me now a man! never, before  
This happy child, did I get anything:  
This oracle of comfort has so pleased me,  
That when I am in heaven I shall desire  
To see what this child does, and praise my Maker.  
I have received much honour by your presence,  
And ye shall find me thankful. Lead the way, lords:  
Ye must all see the queen, and she must thank ye,  
She will be sick else. This day, no man think  
Has business at his house; for all shall stay:  
This little one shall make it holiday.

*Exeunt*

## EPILOGUE

**EPILOGUE**  
'Tis ten to one this play can never please  
All that are here: some come to take their ease,  
And sleep an act or two; but those, we fear,  
We have frighted with our trumpets; so, 'tis clear,  
They'll say 'tis naught: others, to hear the city  
Abused extremely, and to cry 'That's witty!'  
Which we have not done neither: that, I fear,  
All the expected good we're like to hear  
For this play at this time, is only in  
The merciful construction of good women;  
For such a one we show'd 'em: if they smile,  
And say 'twill do, I know, within a while  
All the best men are ours; for 'tis ill hap,  
If they hold when their ladies bid 'em clap.

*Exeunt.*

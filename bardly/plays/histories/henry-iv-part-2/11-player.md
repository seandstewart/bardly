## ACT I

### SCENE I. Warkworth. Before the Castle

*Enter HASTINGS and NORTHUMBERLAND separately.*

**NORTHUMBERLAND**  
What news, Lord Hastings? every minute now  
Should be the father of some stratagem:  
The times are wild: contention, like a horse  
Full of high feeding, madly hath broke loose  
And bears down all before him.

**HASTINGS**  
Noble earl,  
The king is almost wounded to the death;  
And, in the fortune of my lord your son,  
Prince Harry slain outright; and both the Blunts  
Kill'd by the hand of Douglas; young Prince John  
And Westmoreland and Stafford fled the field;  
And Harry Monmouth's brawn, the hulk Sir John,  
Is prisoner to your son: O, such a day,  
So fought, so follow'd and so fairly won,  
Came not till now to dignify the times,  
Since Caesar's fortunes!

**NORTHUMBERLAND**  
Saw you the field? came you from Shrewsbury?

**HASTINGS**  
I spake with one, my lord, that came from thence,  
A gentleman well bred and of good name,  
That freely render'd me these news for true.

*Enter MORTON*

**NORTHUMBERLAND**  
Say, Morton, didst thou come from Shrewsbury?

**MORTON**  
I ran from Shrewsbury, my noble lord;  
Where hateful death put on his ugliest mask  
To fright our party.

**NORTHUMBERLAND**  
How doth my son and brother?  
Thou tremblest; and the whiteness in thy cheek  
Is apter than thy tongue to tell thy errand.  
This thou wouldst say, 'Your son did thus and thus;  
Your brother thus: so fought the noble Douglas:'  
Stopping my greedy ear with their bold deeds:  
But in the end, to stop my ear indeed,  
Thou hast a sigh to blow away this praise,  
Ending with 'Brother, son, and all are dead.'

**MORTON**  
Douglas is living, and your brother, yet;  
But, for my lord your son--

**NORTHUMBERLAND**  
Why, he is dead.  
See what a ready tongue suspicion hath!  
He that but fears the thing he would not know  
Hath by instinct knowledge from others' eyes  
That what he fear'd is chanced. Yet speak, Morton;  
Tell thou an earl his divination lies,  
And I will take it as a sweet disgrace  
And make thee rich for doing me such wrong.

**MORTON**  
You are too great to be by me gainsaid:  
Your spirit is too true, your fears too certain.

**NORTHUMBERLAND**  
Yet, for all this, say not that Percy's dead.  
I see a strange confession in thine eye:  
Thou shakest thy head and hold'st it fear or sin  
To speak a truth. If he be slain, say so;  
The tongue offends not that reports his death:  
And he doth sin that doth belie the dead,  
Not he which says the dead is not alive.  
Yet the first bringer of unwelcome news  
Hath but a losing office, and his tongue  
Sounds ever after as a sullen bell,  
Remember'd tolling a departing friend.

**MORTON**  
I am sorry I should force you to believe  
That which I would to God I had not seen;  
But these mine eyes saw him in bloody state,  
Rendering faint quittance, wearied and out-breathed,  
To Harry Monmouth; whose swift wrath beat down  
The never-daunted Percy to the earth,  
From whence with life he never more sprung up.  
In few, his death, whose spirit lent a fire  
Even to the dullest peasant in his camp,  
Being bruited once, took fire and heat away  
From the best temper'd courage in his troops;  
For from his metal was his party steel'd;  
Which once in him abated, all the rest  
Turn'd on themselves, like dull and heavy lead:  
And as the thing that's heavy in itself,  
Upon enforcement flies with greatest speed,  
So did our men, heavy in Hotspur's loss,  
Lend to this weight such lightness with their fear  
That arrows fled not swifter toward their aim  
Than did our soldiers, aiming at their safety,  
Fly from the field. Then was the noble Worcester  
Too soon ta'en prisoner; and that furious Scot,  
The bloody Douglas, whose well-labouring sword  
Had three times slain the appearance of the king,  
'Gan vail his stomach and did grace the shame  
Of those that turn'd their backs, and in his flight,  
Stumbling in fear, was took. The sum of all  
Is that the king hath won, and hath sent out  
A speedy power to encounter you, my lord,  
Under the conduct of young Lancaster  
And Westmoreland. This is the news at full.

**NORTHUMBERLAND**  
For this I shall have time enough to mourn.  
In poison there is physic; and these news,  
Having been well, that would have made me sick,  
Being sick, have in some measure made me well:  
And as the wretch, whose fever-weaken'd joints,  
Like strengthless hinges, buckle under life,  
Impatient of his fit, breaks like a fire  
Out of his keeper's arms, even so my limbs,  
Weaken'd with grief, being now enraged with grief,  
Are thrice themselves. Hence, therefore, thou nice crutch!  
A scaly gauntlet now with joints of steel  
Must glove this hand: and hence, thou sickly quoif!  
Thou art a guard too wanton for the head  
Which princes, flesh'd with conquest, aim to hit.  
Now bind my brows with iron; and approach  
The ragged'st hour that time and spite dare bring  
To frown upon the enraged Northumberland!  
Let heaven kiss earth! now let not Nature's hand  
Keep the wild flood confined! let order die!  
And let this world no longer be a stage  
To feed contention in a lingering act;  
But let one spirit of the first-born Cain  
Reign in all bosoms, that, each heart being set  
On bloody courses, the rude scene may end,  
And darkness be the burier of the dead!

**MORTON**  
This strained passion doth you wrong, my lord.

**HASTINGS**  
Sweet earl, divorce not wisdom from your honour.

We all that are engaged to this loss  
Knew that we ventured on such dangerous seas  
That if we wrought our life 'twas ten to one;  
And yet we ventured, for the gain proposed  
Choked the respect of likely peril fear'd;  
And since we are o'erset, venture again.  
Come, we will all put forth, body and goods.

**MORTON**  
'Tis more than time: and, my most noble lord,  
I hear for certain, and do speak the truth,  
The gentle Archbishop of York is up  
With well-appointed powers: he is a man  
Who with a double surety binds his followers.  
My lord your son had only but the corpse,  
But shadows and the shows of men, to fight;  
For that same word, rebellion, did divide  
The action of their bodies from their souls;  
And they did fight with queasiness, constrain'd,  
As men drink potions, that their weapons only  
Seem'd on our side; but, for their spirits and souls,  
This word, rebellion, it had froze them up,  
As fish are in a pond. But now the bishop  
Turns insurrection to religion.

**NORTHUMBERLAND**  
I knew of this before; but, to speak truth,  
This present grief had wiped it from my mind.  
Go in with me; and counsel every man  
The aptest way for safety and revenge:  
Get posts and letters, and make friends with speed:  
Never so few, and never yet more need.

*Exeunt*

### SCENE II. London. A street.

*Enter FALSTAFF, with his Page bearing his sword and buckler*

**FALSTAFF**  
Sirrah, you giant, what says the doctor to my water?

**Page**  
He said, sir, the water itself was a good healthy  
water; but, for the party that owed it, he might  
have more diseases than he knew for.

**FALSTAFF**  
Men of all sorts take a pride to gird at me: the  
brain of this foolish-compounded clay, man, is not  
able to invent anything that tends to laughter, more  
than I invent or is invented on me: I am not only  
witty in myself, but the cause that wit is in other  
men. I do here walk before thee like a sow that  
hath overwhelmed all her litter but one. If the  
prince put thee into my service for any other reason  
than to set me off, why then I have no judgment.  
I was never  
manned with an agate till now: but I will inset you  
neither in gold nor silver, but in vile apparel, and  
send you back again to your master, for a jewel,--  
the juvenal, the prince your master, whose chin is  
not yet fledged. I will sooner have a beard grow in  
the palm of my hand than he shall get one on his  
cheek; and yet he will not stick to say his face is  
a face-royal: God may finish it when he will, 'tis  
not a hair amiss yet: he may keep it still at a  
face-royal, for a barber shall never earn sixpence  
out of it; and yet he'll be crowing as if he had  
writ man ever since his father was a bachelor. He  
may keep his own grace, but he's almost out of mine,  
I can assure him. Where's Bardolph?

**Page**  
He's gone into Smithfield to buy your worship a horse.

**FALSTAFF**  
I bought him in Paul's, and he'll buy me a horse in  
Smithfield: an I could get me but a wife in the  
stews, I were manned, horsed, and wived.

*Enter the Lord Chief-Justice*

**Page**  
Sir, here comes the nobleman that committed the  
Prince for striking him about Bardolph.

**Lord Chief-Justice**  
What's he that goes there?

**Page**  
Falstaff, an't please your lordship.

**Lord Chief-Justice**  
He that was in question for the robbery?

**Page**  
He, my lord: but he hath since done good service at  
Shrewsbury; and, is now going with some  
charge to the Lord John of Lancaster.

**Lord Chief-Justice**  
What, to York? Call him back again.

**Page**  
Sir John Falstaff!

**FALSTAFF**  
Boy, tell him I am deaf.

**Page**  
You must speak louder; my master is deaf.

**Lord Chief-Justice**  
I am sure he is, to the hearing of anything good.  
Go, pluck him by the elbow; I must speak with him.

**Page**  
Sir John!

**FALSTAFF**  
What! a young knave, and begging! Is there not  
wars? is there not employment? doth not the king  
lack subjects? do not the rebels need soldiers?  
Though it be a shame to be on any side but one, it  
is worse shame to beg than to be on the worst side,  
were it worse than the name of rebellion can tell  
how to make it.

**Lord Chief-Justice**  
Sir John Falstaff, a word with you.

**FALSTAFF**  
My good lord! God give your lordship good time of  
day. I am glad to see your lordship abroad: I hope your lordship  
goes abroad by advice. Your lordship, though not  
clean past your youth, hath yet some smack of age in  
you, some relish of the saltness of time; and I must  
humbly beseech your lordship to have a reverent care  
of your health.

**Lord Chief-Justice**  
Sir John, I sent for you before your expedition to  
Shrewsbury.

**FALSTAFF**  
An't please your lordship, I hear his majesty is  
returned with some discomfort from Wales.

**Lord Chief-Justice**  
I talk not of his majesty: you would not come when  
I sent for you.

**FALSTAFF**  
And I hear, moreover, his highness is fallen into  
this same whoreson apoplexy.

**Lord Chief-Justice**  
Well, God mend him! I pray you, let me speak with  
you.

**FALSTAFF**  
This apoplexy is, as I take it, a kind of lethargy,  
an't please your lordship; a kind of sleeping in the  
blood, a whoreson tingling.

**Lord Chief-Justice**  
What tell you me of it? be it as it is.

**FALSTAFF**  
It hath its original from much grief, from study and  
perturbation of the brain: I have read the cause of  
his effects in Galen: it is a kind of deafness.

**Lord Chief-Justice**  
To punish you by the heels would amend the  
attention of your ears; and I care not if I do  
become your physician.

**FALSTAFF**  
I am as poor as Job, my lord, but not so patient:  
your lordship may minister the potion of  
imprisonment to me in respect of poverty; but how  
should I be your patient to follow your  
prescriptions, the wise may make some dram of a  
scruple, or indeed a scruple itself.

**Lord Chief-Justice**  
I sent for you, when there were matters against you  
for your life, to come speak with me.

**FALSTAFF**  
As I was then advised by my learned counsel in the  
laws of this land-service, I did not come.

**Lord Chief-Justice**  
Well, the truth is, Sir John, you live in great infamy.  
Your means are very slender, and your waste is great.

**FALSTAFF**  
I would it were otherwise; I would my means were  
greater, and my waist slenderer.

**Lord Chief-Justice**  
You have misled the youthful prince.

**FALSTAFF**  
The young prince hath misled me: I am the fellow  
with the great belly, and he my dog.

**Lord Chief-Justice**  
Well, I am loath to gall a new-healed wound: your  
day's service at Shrewsbury hath a little gilded  
over your night's exploit on Gad's-hill: you may  
thank the unquiet time for your quiet o'er-posting  
that action. But since all is well, keep it so: wake not a  
sleeping wolf.

**FALSTAFF**  
To wake a wolf is as bad as to smell a fox.

**Lord Chief-Justice**  
What! you are as a candle, the better part burnt  
out. There is not a white hair on your face but should  
have his effect of gravity.

**FALSTAFF**  
His effect of gravy, gravy, gravy.

**Lord Chief-Justice**  
You follow the young prince up and down, like his  
ill angel.

**FALSTAFF**  
Not so, my lord; your ill angel is light; but I hope  
he that looks upon me will take me without weighing:  
and yet, in some respects, I grant, I cannot go: I  
cannot tell. Virtue is of so little regard in these  
costermonger times that true valour is turned bear-herd:  
You that are old consider not the capacities of us  
that are young; you do measure the heat of our  
livers with the bitterness of your galls: and we  
that are in the vaward of our youth, I must confess,  
are wags too.

**Lord Chief-Justice**  
Do you set down your name in the scroll of youth,  
that are written down old with all the characters of  
age? Have you not a moist eye? a dry hand? a  
yellow cheek? a white beard? a decreasing leg? an  
increasing belly? is not your voice broken? your  
wind short? your chin double? your wit single? and  
every part about you blasted with antiquity? and  
will you yet call yourself young? Fie, fie, fie, Sir John!

**FALSTAFF**  
My lord, I was born about three of the clock in the  
afternoon, with a white head and something a round  
belly. For my voice, I have lost it with halloing  
and singing of anthems. To approve my youth  
further, I will not: the truth is, I am only old in  
judgment and understanding; and he that will caper  
with me for a thousand marks, let him lend me the  
money, and have at him! For the box of the ear that  
the prince gave you, he gave it like a rude prince,  
and you took it like a sensible lord. I have  
chequed him for it, and the young lion repents;  
marry, not in ashes and sackcloth, but in new silk  
and old sack.

**Lord Chief-Justice**  
Well, God send the prince a better companion!

**FALSTAFF**  
God send the companion a better prince! I cannot  
rid my hands of him.

**Lord Chief-Justice**  
Well, the king hath severed you and Prince Harry: I  
hear you are going with Lord John of Lancaster  
against the Archbishop and the Earl of  
Northumberland.

**FALSTAFF**  
Yea; I thank your pretty sweet wit for it. But look  
you pray, all you that kiss my lady Peace at home,  
that our armies join not in a hot day; for, by the  
Lord, I take but two shirts out with me, and I mean  
not to sweat extraordinarily: if it be a hot day,  
and I brandish anything but a bottle, I would I  
might never spit white again. There is not a  
dangerous action can peep out his head but I am  
thrust upon it: well, I cannot last ever: but it  
was alway yet the trick of our English nation, if  
they have a good thing, to make it too common.  
I would to God my name were not so  
terrible to the enemy as it is: I were better to be  
eaten to death with a rust than to be scoured to  
nothing with perpetual motion.

**Lord Chief-Justice**  
Well, be honest, be honest; and God bless your  
expedition!

**FALSTAFF**  
Will your lordship lend me a thousand pound to  
furnish me forth?

**Lord Chief-Justice**  
Not a penny, not a penny; you are too impatient to  
bear crosses. Fare you well.

*Exeunt Chief-Justice*

**FALSTAFF**  
If I do, fillip me with a three-man beetle. A man  
can no more separate age and covetousness than a'  
can part young limbs and lechery: but the gout  
galls the one, and the pox pinches the other; and  
so both the degrees prevent my curses. Boy!

What money is in my purse?

**Page**  
Seven groats and two pence.

**FALSTAFF**  
I can get no remedy against this consumption of the  
purse: borrowing only lingers and lingers it out,  
but the disease is incurable. Go bear this letter  
to my Lord of Lancaster; this to the prince; this  
to the Earl of Westmoreland; and this to old  
Mistress Ursula, whom I have weekly sworn to marry  
since I perceived the first white hair on my chin.  
About it: you know where to find me.

*Exit Page*

A pox of this gout! or, a gout of this pox! for  
the one or the other plays the rogue with my great  
toe. 'Tis no matter if I do halt; I have the wars  
for my colour, and my pension shall seem the more  
reasonable. A good wit will make use of any thing:  
I will turn diseases to commodity.

*Exit*

### SCENE III. York. The Archbishop's palace.

*Enter the ARCHBISHOP OF YORK, the Lords HASTINGS and MOWBRAY*

**ARCHBISHOP OF YORK**  
Thus have you heard our cause and known our means;  
And first, lord marshal, what say you to it?

**MOWBRAY**  
I well allow the occasion of our arms;  
But gladly would be better satisfied  
How in our means we should advance ourselves  
To look with forehead bold and big enough  
Upon the power and puissance of the king.

**HASTINGS**  
Our present musters grow upon the file  
To five and twenty thousand men of choice;  
And our supplies live largely in the hope  
Of great Northumberland, whose bosom burns  
With an incensed fire of injuries.

**MOWBRAY**  
The question then, Lord Hastings, standeth thus;  
Whether our present five and twenty thousand  
May hold up head without Northumberland?

**HASTINGS**  
With him, we may.

**MOWBRAY**  
But if without him we be thought too feeble,  
My judgment is, we should not step too far  
Till we had his assistance by the hand.

**ARCHBISHOP OF YORK**  
'Tis very true, Lord Marshall; for indeed  
It was young Hotspur's case at Shrewsbury.

**HASTINGS**  
I think we are a body strong enough,  
Even as we are, to equal with the king.

**MOWBRAY**  
What, is the king but five and twenty thousand?

**HASTINGS**  
To us no more; nay, not so much, Lord Marshall.  
For his divisions, as the times do brawl,  
Are in three heads: one power against the French,  
And one against Glendower; perforce a third  
Must take up us: so is the unfirm king  
In three divided; and his coffers sound  
With hollow poverty and emptiness.

**ARCHBISHOP OF YORK**  
That he should draw his several strengths together  
And come against us in full puissance,  
Need not be dreaded.

**HASTINGS**  
If he should do so,  
He leaves his back unarm'd, the French and Welsh  
Baying him at the heels: never fear that.

**MOWBRAY**  
Who is it like should lead his forces hither?

**HASTINGS**  
The Duke of Lancaster and Westmoreland;  
Against the Welsh, himself and Harry Monmouth:  
But who is substituted 'gainst the French,  
I have no certain notice.

**ARCHBISHOP OF YORK**  
Let us on,  
And publish the occasion of our arms.  
The commonwealth is sick of their own choice;  
Their over-greedy love hath surfeited:  
An habitation giddy and unsure  
Hath he that buildeth on the vulgar heart.

**MOWBRAY**  
Shall we go draw our numbers and set on?

**HASTINGS**  
We are time's subjects, and time bids be gone.

*Exeunt*

## ACT II

### SCENE I. London. A street.

*Enter MISTRESS QUICKLY, FANG following.*

**MISTRESS QUICKLY**  
Master Fang, have you entered the action?

**FANG**  
It is entered. We must arrest Sir John Falstaff.

**MISTRESS QUICKLY**  
Yea, good Master Fang; I have entered him and all.

**FANG**  
It may chance cost some of us our lives, for he will stab.

**MISTRESS QUICKLY**  
Alas the day! take heed of him; he stabbed me in  
mine own house, and that most beastly: in good  
faith, he cares not what mischief he does. If his  
weapon be out: he will foin like any devil; he will  
spare neither man, woman, nor child.

**FANG**  
If I can close with him, I care not for his thrust.

**MISTRESS QUICKLY**  
No, nor I neither: I'll be at your elbow.

**FANG**  
An I but fist him once; an a' come but within my vice,--

**MISTRESS QUICKLY**  
I am undone by his going; I warrant you, he's an  
infinitive thing upon my score. Good Master Fang,  
hold him sure:

A hundred mark is a long one for a poor lone woman to  
bear: and I have borne, and borne, and borne, and  
have been fubbed off, and fubbed off, and fubbed  
off, from this day to that day, that it is a shame  
to be thought on. There is no honesty in such  
dealing; unless a woman should be made an ass and a  
beast, to bear every knave's wrong. Yonder he  
comes; and that errant malmsey-nose knave, Bardolph,  
with him. Do your offices, do your offices: Master  
Fang, do me, do me, do me your offices.

*Enter FALSTAFF, and BARDOLPH*

**FALSTAFF**  
How now! whose mare's dead? what's the matter?

**FANG**  
Sir John, I arrest you at the suit of Mistress Quickly.

**FALSTAFF**  
Away, varlets! Draw, Bardolph: cut me off the  
villain's head: throw the quean in the channel.

**MISTRESS QUICKLY**  
Throw me in the channel! I'll throw thee in the  
channel. Wilt thou? wilt thou? thou bastardly  
rogue! Murder, murder! Ah, thou honeysuckle  
villain! wilt thou kill God's officers and the  
king's? Ah, thou honey-seed rogue! thou art a  
honey-seed, a man-queller, and a woman-queller.

**FALSTAFF**  
Away, you scullion! you rampallion! You  
fustilarian! I'll tickle your catastrophe.

*Enter the Lord Chief-Justice*

**Lord Chief-Justice**  
What is the matter? keep the peace here, ho!

**MISTRESS QUICKLY**  
Good my lord, be good to me. I beseech you, stand to me.

**Lord Chief-Justice**  
How now, Sir John! what are you brawling here?  
You should have been well on your way to York.  
Stand from him, fellow: wherefore hang'st upon him?

**MISTRESS QUICKLY**  
O most worshipful lord, an't please your grace, I am  
a poor widow of Eastcheap, and he is arrested at my suit.

**Lord Chief-Justice**  
For what sum?

**MISTRESS QUICKLY**  
It is more than for some, my lord; it is for all,  
all I have. He hath eaten me out of house and home;  
he hath put all my substance into that fat belly of  
his: but I will have some of it out again, or I  
will ride thee o' nights like the mare.

**FALSTAFF**  
I think I am as like to ride the mare, if I have  
any vantage of ground to get up.

**Lord Chief-Justice**  
How comes this, Sir John? Fie! what man of good  
temper would endure this tempest of exclamation?  
Are you not ashamed to enforce a poor widow to so  
rough a course to come by her own?

**FALSTAFF**  
What is the gross sum that I owe thee?

**MISTRESS QUICKLY**  
Marry, if thou wert an honest man, thyself and the  
money too. Thou didst swear to me upon a  
parcel-gilt goblet, sitting in my Dolphin-chamber,  
at the round table, by a sea-coal fire, upon  
Wednesday in Wheeson week, as I was  
washing thy wound, to marry me and make me my lady  
thy wife. Canst thou deny it? Did not goodwife  
Keech, the butcher's wife, come in then and call me  
gossip Quickly? coming in to borrow a mess of  
vinegar; telling us she had a good dish of prawns;  
whereby thou didst desire to eat some; whereby I  
told thee they were ill for a green wound? And  
didst thou not, when she was gone down stairs,  
desire me to be no more so familiarity with such  
poor people; saying that ere long they should call  
me madam? And didst thou not kiss me and bid me  
fetch thee thirty shillings? I put thee now to thy  
book-oath: deny it, if thou canst.

**FALSTAFF**  
My lord, this is a poor mad soul; and she says up  
and down the town that the eldest son is like you:  
she hath been in good case, and the truth is,  
poverty hath distracted her. But for these foolish  
officers, I beseech you I may have redress against them.

**Lord Chief-Justice**  
Sir John, Sir John, I am well acquainted with your  
manner of wrenching the true cause the false way. It  
is not a confident brow, nor the throng of words  
that come with such more than impudent sauciness  
from you, can thrust me from a level consideration:  
you have, as it appears to me, practiced upon the  
easy-yielding spirit of this woman, and made her  
serve your uses both in purse and in person.

**MISTRESS QUICKLY**  
Yea, in truth, my lord.

**Lord Chief-Justice**  
Pray thee, peace. Pay her the debt you owe her, and  
unpay the villany you have done her: the one you  
may do with sterling money, and the other with  
current repentance.

**FALSTAFF**  
Come hither, hostess.

*Enter GOWER*

**Lord Chief-Justice**  
Now, Master Gower, what news?

**GOWER**  
The king, my lord, and Harry Prince of Wales  
Are near at hand: the rest the paper tells.

**FALSTAFF**  
As I am a gentleman. Come, no more words of it.

**MISTRESS QUICKLY**  
By this heavenly ground I tread on, I must be fain  
to pawn both my plate and the tapestry of my  
dining-chambers.

**FALSTAFF**  
Come, an 'twere not for thy humours, there's  
not a better wench in England. Go, wash thy face,  
and draw the action. Come, thou must not be in  
this humour with me; dost not know me? come, come, I  
know thou wast set on to this.

**MISTRESS QUICKLY**  
Pray thee, Sir John, let it be but twenty nobles: i'  
faith, I am loath to pawn my plate, so God save me,  
la! I hope you'll come to supper. You'll pay me all together?

**FALSTAFF**  
Will I live?

*To BARDOLPH*

Go, with her, with her; hook on, hook on.

**MISTRESS QUICKLY**  
Will you have Doll Tearsheet meet you at supper?

**FALSTAFF**  
No more words; let's have her.

*Exeunt all but Lord Chief-Justice, GOWER, and FALSTAFF*

**Lord Chief-Justice**  
Where lay the king last night?

**GOWER**  
At Basingstoke, my lord.

**FALSTAFF**  
I hope, my lord, all's well: what is the news, my lord?

**Lord Chief-Justice**  
Come all his forces back?

**GOWER**  
No; fifteen hundred foot, five hundred horse,  
Are marched up to my lord of Lancaster,  
Against Northumberland and the Archbishop.

**FALSTAFFf**  
Comes the king back from Wales, my noble lord?

**Lord Chief-Justice**  
You shall have letters of me presently:  
Come, go along with me, good Master Gower.

**FALSTAFF**  
Master Gower, shall I entreat you with me to dinner?

**GOWER**  
I must wait upon my good lord here; I thank you,  
good Sir John.

**Lord Chief-Justice**  
Sir John, you loiter here too long, being you are to  
take soldiers up in counties as you go.

**FALSTAFF**  
Will you sup with me, Master Gower?

**Lord Chief-Justice**  
What foolish master taught you these manners, Sir John?

**FALSTAFF**  
Master Gower, if they become me not, he was a fool  
that taught them me. This is the right fencing  
grace, my lord; tap for tap, and so part fair.

**Lord Chief-Justice**  
Now the Lord lighten thee! thou art a great fool.

*Exeunt*

### SCENE II. London. Another street.

*Enter PRINCE HENRY and POINS*

**PRINCE HENRY**  
Before God, I am exceeding weary.

**POINS**  
Is't come to that? I had thought weariness durst not  
have attached one of so high blood.

**PRINCE HENRY**  
Faith, it does me; though it discolours the  
complexion of my greatness to acknowledge it. Doth  
it not show vilely in me to desire small beer?

**POINS**  
Why, a prince should not be so loosely studied as  
to remember so weak a composition.

**PRINCE HENRY**  
Belike then my appetite was not princely got; for,  
by my troth, I do now remember the poor creature,  
small beer. But, indeed, these humble  
considerations make me out of love with my  
greatness. What a disgrace is it to me to remember  
thy name! or to know thy face to-morrow! or to  
take note how many pair of silk stockings thou  
hast, viz. these, and those that were thy  
peach-coloured ones!

**POINS**  
How ill it follows, after you have laboured so hard,  
you should talk so idly! Tell me, how many good  
young princes would do so, their fathers being so  
sick as yours at this time is?

**PRINCE HENRY**  
Shall I tell thee one thing, Poins?

**POINS**  
Yes, faith; and let it be an excellent good thing.

**PRINCE HENRY**  
Marry, I tell thee, it is not meet that I should be  
sad, now my father is sick: albeit I could tell  
thee, as to one it pleases me, for fault of a  
better, to call my friend, I could be sad, and sad  
indeed too.

**POINS**  
Very hardly upon such a subject.

**PRINCE HENRY**  
By this hand thou thinkest me as far in the devil's  
book as thou and Falstaff for obduracy and  
persistency: let the end try the man. But I tell  
thee, my heart bleeds inwardly that my father is so  
sick: and keeping such vile company as thou art  
hath in reason taken from me all ostentation of sorrow.

**POINS**  
The reason?

**PRINCE HENRY**  
What wouldst thou think of me, if I should weep?

**POINS**  
I would think thee a most princely hypocrite.

**PRINCE HENRY**  
It would be every man's thought; and thou art a  
blessed fellow to think as every man thinks: never  
a man's thought in the world keeps the road-way  
better than thine: every man would think me an  
hypocrite indeed. And what accites your most  
worshipful thought to think so?

**POINS**  
Why, because you have been so lewd and so much  
engraffed to Falstaff.

**PRINCE HENRY**  
And to thee.

**POINS**  
By this light, I am well spoke on; I can hear it  
with my own ears: the worst that they can say of  
me is that I am a second brother and that I am a  
proper fellow of my hands; and those two things, I  
confess, I cannot help. By the mass, here comes Bardolph.

*Enter BARDOLPH and Page*

**BARDOLPH**  
God save your grace!

**PRINCE HENRY**  
And yours, most noble Bardolph!

**BARDOLPH**  
Come, you virtuous ass, you bashful fool, must you  
be blushing? wherefore blush you now? What a  
maidenly man-at-arms are you become! Is't such a  
matter to get a pottle-pot's maidenhead?

**Page**  
A' calls me e'en now, my lord, through a red  
lattice, and I could discern no part of his face  
from the window: at last I spied his eyes, and  
methought he had made two holes in the ale-wife's  
new petticoat and so peeped through.

**PRINCE HENRY**  
Has not the boy profited?

**BARDOLPH**  
Away, you whoreson upright rabbit, away!

**Page**  
Away, you rascally Althaea's dream, away!

**PRINCE HENRY**  
Instruct us, boy; what dream, boy?

**Page**  
Marry, my lord, Althaea dreamed she was delivered  
of a fire-brand; and therefore I call him her dream.

**POINS**  
O, that this good blossom could be kept from  
cankers! Well, there is sixpence to preserve thee.

**BARDOLPH**  
An you do not make him hanged among you, the  
gallows shall have wrong.

**PRINCE HENRY**  
And how doth thy master, Bardolph?

**BARDOLPH**  
Well, my lord. He heard of your grace's coming to  
town: there's a letter for you.

**PRINCE HENRY**  
I do allow this wen to be as familiar with me as my  
dog; and he holds his place; for look you how he writes.

**POINS**  
*\[Reads]*  
'Sir John Falstaff, knight, to the son of  
the king, nearest his father, Harry Prince of  
Wales, greeting.' Why, this is a certificate.

**PRINCE HENRY**  
Peace!

**POINS**  
*\[Reads]*  
'I will imitate the honourable Romans in  
brevity:' he sure means brevity in breath,  
short-winded. 'I commend me to thee, I commend  
thee, and I leave thee. Be not too familiar with  
Poins; for he misuses thy favours so much, that he  
swears thou art to marry his sister Nell. Repent  
at idle times as thou mayest; and so, farewell.  
Thine, by yea and no, which is as much as to  
say, as thou usest him, JACK FALSTAFF with my  
familiars, JOHN with my brothers and sisters,  
and SIR JOHN with all Europe.'  
My lord, I'll steep this letter in sack and make him eat it.

**PRINCE HENRY**  
That's to make him eat twenty of his words. But do  
you use me thus, Ned? must I marry your sister?

**POINS**  
God send the wench no worse fortune! But I never said so.

**PRINCE HENRY**  
Well, thus we play the fools with the time, and the  
spirits of the wise sit in the clouds and mock us.  
Is your master here in London?

**BARDOLPH**  
Yea, my lord.

**PRINCE HENRY**  
Where sups he? doth the old boar feed in the old frank?

**BARDOLPH**  
At the old place, my lord, in Eastcheap.

**PRINCE HENRY**  
Sup any women with him?

**Page**  
None, my lord, but old Mistress Quickly and  
Mistress Doll Tearsheet.

**PRINCE HENRY**  
What pagan may that be?

**Page**  
A proper gentlewoman, sir, and a kinswoman of my master's.

**PRINCE HENRY**  
Even such kin as the parish heifers are to the town  
bull. Shall we steal upon them, Ned, at supper?

**POINS**  
I am your shadow, my lord; I'll follow you.

**PRINCE HENRY**  
Sirrah, you boy, and Bardolph, no word to your  
master that I am yet come to town: there's for  
your silence.

**BARDOLPH**  
I have no tongue, sir.

**Page**  
And for mine, sir, I will govern it.

**PRINCE HENRY**  
Fare you well; go.

*Exeunt BARDOLPH and Page*

This Doll Tearsheet should be some road.

**POINS**  
I warrant you, as common as the way between Saint  
Alban's and London.

**PRINCE HENRY**  
How might we see Falstaff bestow himself to-night  
in his true colors, and not ourselves be seen?

**POINS**  
Put on two leathern jerkins and aprons, and wait  
upon him at his table as drawers.

**PRINCE HENRY**  
From a God to a bull? a heavy decension! it was  
Jove's case. From a prince to a prentice? a low  
transformation! that shall be mine; for in every  
thing the purpose must weigh with the folly.  
Follow me, Ned.

*Exeunt*

### SCENE III. Warkworth. Before the castle.

*Enter NORTHUMBERLAND, LADY NORTHUMBERLAND, and LADY PERCY*

**NORTHUMBERLAND**  
I pray thee, loving wife, and gentle daughter,  
Give even way unto my rough affairs:  
Put not you on the visage of the times  
And be like them to Percy troublesome

**LADY PERCY**  
I have given over, I will speak no more:  
Do what you will; your wisdom be your guide.

**NORTHUMBERLAND**  
Alas, sweet wife, my honour is at pawn;  
And, but my going, nothing can redeem it.

**LADY PERCY**  
O yet, for God's sake, go not to these wars!  
The time was, father, that you broke your word,  
When you were more endeared to it than now;  
When your own Percy, when my heart's dear Harry,  
Threw many a northward look to see his father  
Bring up his powers; but he did long in vain.  
Who then persuaded you to stay at home?  
There were two honours lost, yours and your son's.  
For yours, the God of heaven brighten it!  
For his, it stuck upon him as the sun  
In the grey vault of heaven, and by his light  
Did all the chivalry of England move  
To do brave acts: he was indeed the glass  
Wherein the noble youth did dress themselves:  
He had no legs that practised not his gait;  
And speaking thick, which nature made his blemish,  
Became the accents of the valiant;  
For those that could speak low and tardily  
Would turn their own perfection to abuse,  
To seem like him: so that in speech, in gait,  
In diet, in affections of delight,  
In military rules, humours of blood,  
He was the mark and glass, copy and book,  
That fashion'd others. And him, O wondrous him!  
O miracle of men! him did you leave,  
Second to none, unseconded by you,  
To look upon the hideous god of war  
In disadvantage; to abide a field  
Where nothing but the sound of Hotspur's name  
Did seem defensible: so you left him.  
Never, O never, do his ghost the wrong  
To hold your honour more precise and nice  
With others than with him! let them alone:  
The marshal and the archbishop are strong:  
Had my sweet Harry had but half their numbers,  
To-day might I, hanging on Hotspur's neck,  
Have talk'd of Monmouth's grave.

**NORTHUMBERLAND**  
Beshrew your heart,  
Fair daughter, you do draw my spirits from me  
With new lamenting ancient oversights.  
But I must go and meet with danger there,  
Or it will seek me in another place  
And find me worse provided.

**LADY PERCY**  
O, fly to Scotland,  
Till that the nobles and the armed commons  
Have of their puissance made a little taste.
If they get ground and vantage of the king,  
Then join you with them, like a rib of steel,  
To make strength stronger; but, for all our loves,  
First let them try themselves. So did your son;  
He was so suffer'd: so came I a widow;  
And never shall have length of life enough  
To rain upon remembrance with mine eyes,  
That it may grow and sprout as high as heaven,  
For recordation to my noble husband.

**NORTHUMBERLAND**  
Come, come, go in with me. 'Tis with my mind  
As with the tide swell'd up unto his height,  
That makes a still-stand, running neither way:  
Fain would I go to meet the archbishop,  
But many thousand reasons hold me back.  
I will resolve for Scotland: there am I,  
Till time and vantage crave my company.

*Exeunt*

### SCENE IV. London. The Boar's-head Tavern in Eastcheap.

*Enter MISTRESS QUICKLY and DOLL TEARSHEET*

**MISTRESS QUICKLY**  
I' faith, sweetheart, methinks now you are in an  
excellent good temperality: your pulsidge beats as  
extraordinarily as heart would desire; and your  
colour, I warrant you, is as red as any rose, in good  
truth, la! But, i' faith, you have drunk too much  
canaries; and that's a marvellous searching wine,  
and it perfumes the blood ere one can say 'What's  
this?' How do you now?

**DOLL TEARSHEET**  
Better than I was: hem!

**MISTRESS QUICKLY**  
Why, that's well said; a good heart's worth gold.  
Lo, here comes Sir John.

*Enter FALSTAFF*

**FALSTAFF**  
*\[Singing]*  
'When Arthur first in court,'  
'And was a worthy king.'

*\[Speaking]*  
How now, Mistress Doll!

**DOLL TEARSHEET**  
You muddy rascal, is that all the comfort you give me?

**FALSTAFF**  
You make fat rascals, Mistress Doll.

**DOLL TEARSHEET**  
I make them! gluttony and diseases make them; I  
make them not.

**FALSTAFF**  
If the cook help to make the gluttony, you help to  
make the diseases, Doll: we catch of you, Doll, we  
catch of you; grant that, my poor virtue grant that.

**DOLL TEARSHEET**  
Yea, joy, our chains and our jewels.

**FALSTAFF**  
'Your broaches, pearls, and ouches:' for to serve  
bravely is to come halting off, you know: to come  
off the breach with his pike bent bravely, and to  
surgery bravely; to venture upon the charged  
chambers bravely,--

**DOLL TEARSHEET**  
Hang yourself, you muddy conger, hang yourself!

**MISTRESS QUICKLY**  
By my troth, this is the old fashion; you two never  
meet but you fall to some discord: you are both,  
i' good truth, as rheumatic as two dry toasts; you  
cannot one bear with another's confirmities. What  
the good-year! one must bear, and that must be  
you: you are the weaker vessel, as they say, the  
emptier vessel.

**DOLL TEARSHEET**  
Can a weak empty vessel bear such a huge full  
hogshead? there's a whole merchant's venture of  
Bourdeaux stuff in him; you have not seen a hulk  
better stuffed in the hold. Come, I'll be friends  
with thee, Jack: thou art going to the wars; and  
whether I shall ever see thee again or no, there is  
nobody cares.

*Enter BARDOLPH*

**BARDOLPH**  
Sir, Ancient Pistol's below, and would speak with  
you.

**DOLL TEARSHEET**  
Hang him, swaggering rascal! let him not come  
hither: it is the foul-mouthed'st rogue in England.

**MISTRESS QUICKLY**  
If he swagger, let him not come here: no, by my  
faith; I must live among my neighbours: I'll no  
swaggerers: I am in good name and fame with the  
very best: shut the door; there comes no swaggerers  
here: I have not lived all this while, to have  
swaggering now: shut the door, I pray you.

**FALSTAFF**  
Dost thou hear, hostess?

**MISTRESS QUICKLY**  
Tilly-fally, Sir John, ne'er tell me: your ancient  
swaggerer comes not in my doors. I was before Master  
Tisick, the debuty, t'other day; and, as he said to  
me, 'twas no longer ago than Wednesday last, 'I'  
good faith, neighbour Quickly,' says he; Master  
Dumbe, our minister, was by then; 'neighbour  
Quickly,' says he, 'receive those that are civil;  
for,' said he, 'you are in an ill name:' now a'  
said so, I can tell whereupon; 'for,' says he, 'you  
are an honest woman, and well thought on; therefore  
take heed what guests you receive: receive,' says  
he, 'no swaggering companions.' There comes none  
here: you would bless you to hear what he said:  
no, I'll no swaggerers.

**FALSTAFF**  
He's no swaggerer, hostess; a tame cheater, i'  
faith; call him up, Bardolph.

*Exit BARDOLPH*

**MISTRESS QUICKLY**  
Cheater, call you him? I will bar no honest man my  
house, nor no cheater: but I do not love  
swaggering, by my troth; I am the worse, when one  
says swagger: feel, masters, how I shake; look you,  
I warrant you.

**DOLL TEARSHEET**  
So you do, hostess.

**MISTRESS QUICKLY**  
Do I? yea, in very truth, do I, an 'twere an aspen  
leaf: I cannot abide swaggerers.

*Enter PISTOL, and BARDOLPH*

**PISTOL**  
God save you, Sir John!

**FALSTAFF**  
Welcome, Ancient Pistol. Here, Pistol, I charge  
you with a cup of sack: do you discharge upon mine hostess.

**PISTOL**  
I will discharge upon her, Sir John, with two bullets.

**FALSTAFF**  
She is Pistol-proof, sir; you shall hardly offend  
her.

**MISTRESS QUICKLY**  
Come, I'll drink no proofs nor no bullets: I'll  
drink no more than will do me good, for no man's  
pleasure, I.

**PISTOL**  
Then to you, Mistress Dorothy; I will charge you.

**DOLL TEARSHEET**  
Charge me! I scorn you, scurvy companion. What!  
you poor, base, rascally, cheating, lack-linen  
mate! Away, you mouldy rogue, away! I am meat for  
your master.

**PISTOL**  
I know you, Mistress Dorothy.

**DOLL TEARSHEET**  
Away, you cut-purse rascal! you filthy bung, away!  
by this wine, I'll thrust my knife in your mouldy  
chaps, an you play the saucy cuttle with me. Away,  
you bottle-ale rascal! you basket-hilt stale  
juggler, you! Since when, I pray you, sir? God's  
light, with two points on your shoulder? much!

**PISTOL**  
God let me not live, but I will murder your ruff for this.

**MISTRESS QUICKLY**  
No, Good Captain Pistol; not here, sweet captain.

**DOLL TEARSHEET**  
Captain! thou abominable damned cheater, art thou  
not ashamed to be called captain? An captains were  
of my mind, they would truncheon you out, for  
taking their names upon you before you have earned  
them. You a captain! you slave, for what? for  
tearing a poor whore's ruff in a bawdy-house? He a  
captain! hang him, rogue! he lives upon mouldy  
stewed prunes and dried cakes. A captain! God's  
light, these villains will make the word as odious  
as the word 'occupy;' which was an excellent good  
word before it was ill sorted: therefore captains  
had need look to 't.

**BARDOLPH**  
Pray thee, go down.

**PISTOL**  
I'll see her damned first; to Pluto's damned lake,  
by this hand, to the infernal deep, with Erebus and  
tortures vile also. Hold hook and line, say I.  
Down, down, dogs! down, faitors! Have we not  
Hiren here?

**MISTRESS QUICKLY**  
Good Captain Peesel, be quiet; 'tis very late, i'  
faith: I beseek you now, aggravate your choler.

**PISTOL**  
These be good humours, indeed!

**PISTOL**  
Die men like dogs! give crowns like pins! Have we  
not Heren here?

**MISTRESS QUICKLY**  
O' my word, captain, there's none such here. What  
the good-year! do you think I would deny her? For  
God's sake, be quiet.

**PISTOL**  
Then feed, and be fat, my fair Calipolis.  
Come, give's some sack.  
Fear we broadsides? no, let the fiend give fire:  
Give me some sack: and, sweetheart, lie thou there.

*Laying down his sword*

Come we to full points here; and are etceteras nothing?

**FALSTAFF**  
Pistol, I would be quiet.

**PISTOL**  
Sweet knight, I kiss thy neaf: what! we have seen  
the seven stars.

**DOLL TEARSHEET**  
For God's sake, thrust him down stairs: I cannot  
endure such a fustian rascal.

**PISTOL**  
Thrust him down stairs! know we not Galloway nags?

**FALSTAFF**  
Quoit him down, Bardolph, like a shove-groat  
shilling: nay, an a' do nothing but speak nothing,  
a' shall be nothing here.

**BARDOLPH**  
Come, get you down stairs.

**PISTOL**  
What! shall we have incision? shall we imbrue?

*Snatching up his sword*

Then death rock me asleep, abridge my doleful days!

**FALSTAFF**  
Give me my rapier, boy.

**DOLL TEARSHEET**  
I pray thee, Jack, I pray thee, do not draw.

*Drawing, and driving PISTOL out*

**MISTRESS QUICKLY**  
Here's a goodly tumult! I'll forswear keeping  
house, afore I'll be in these tirrits and frights.  
So; murder, I warrant now. Alas, alas! put up  
your naked weapons, put up your naked weapons.

*Exeunt PISTOL and BARDOLPH*

**DOLL TEARSHEET**  
I pray thee, Jack, be quiet; the rascal's gone.  
Ah, you whoreson little valiant villain, you!

**MISTRESS QUICKLY**  
He you not hurt i' the groin? methought a' made a  
shrewd thrust at your belly.

*Re-enter BARDOLPH*

**FALSTAFF**  
Have you turned him out o' doors?

**BARDOLPH**  
Yea, sir. The rascal's drunk: you have hurt him,  
sir, i' the shoulder.

**DOLL TEARSHEET**  
Ah, you sweet little rogue, you! alas, poor ape,  
how thou sweatest! come, let me wipe thy face;  
come on, you whoreson chops: ah, rogue! i'faith, I  
love thee: thou art as valorous as Hector of Troy,  
worth five of Agamemnon, and ten times better than  
the Nine Worthies: ah, villain!

**FALSTAFF**  
A rascally slave! I will toss the rogue in a blanket.

**DOLL TEARSHEET**  
Do, an thou darest for thy heart: an thou dost,  
I'll canvass thee between a pair of sheets.

*Music*

**BARDOLPH**  
The music is come, sir.

**FALSTAFF**  
Let them play. Play, sirs. Sit on my knee, Doll.  
A rascal bragging slave! the rogue fled from me  
like quicksilver.

**DOLL TEARSHEET**  
I' faith, and thou followedst him like a church.  
Thou whoreson little tidy Bartholomew boar-pig,  
when wilt thou leave fighting o' days and foining  
o' nights, and begin to patch up thine old body for heaven?

*Enter, behind, PRINCE HENRY and POINS, disguised*

**FALSTAFF**  
Peace, good Doll! do not speak like a death's-head;  
do not bid me remember mine end.

**DOLL TEARSHEET**  
They say Poins has a good wit.

**FALSTAFF**  
He a good wit? hang him, baboon! his wit's as thick  
as Tewksbury mustard; there's no more conceit in him  
than is in a mallet.

**DOLL TEARSHEET**  
Why does the prince love him so, then?

**FALSTAFF**  
Because their legs are both of a bigness, and a'  
plays at quoits well, and eats conger and fennel,  
and drinks off candles' ends for flap-dragons, and  
rides the wild-mare with the boys, and jumps upon  
joined-stools, and swears with a good grace, and  
wears his boots very smooth, like unto the sign of  
the leg, and breeds no bate with telling of discreet  
stories; and such other gambol faculties a' has,  
that show a weak mind and an able body, for the  
which the prince admits him: for the prince himself  
is such another; the weight of a hair will turn the  
scales between their avoirdupois.

**PRINCE HENRY**  
Would not this nave of a wheel have his ears cut off?

**POINS**  
Let's beat him before his whore.

**PRINCE HENRY**  
Look, whether the withered elder hath not his poll  
clawed like a parrot.

**POINS**  
Is it not strange that desire should so many years  
outlive performance?

**FALSTAFF**  
Kiss me, Doll.

**PRINCE HENRY**  
Saturn and Venus this year in conjunction! what  
says the almanac to that?

**FALSTAFF**  
Thou dost give me flattering busses.

**DOLL TEARSHEET**  
By my troth, I kiss thee with a most constant heart.

**FALSTAFF**  
I am old, I am old.

**DOLL TEARSHEET**  
I love thee better than I love e'er a scurvy young  
boy of them all.

**FALSTAFF**  
What stuff wilt have a kirtle of? I shall receive  
money o' Thursday: shalt have a cap to-morrow. A  
merry song, come: it grows late; we'll to bed.  
Thou'lt forget me when I am gone.

**DOLL TEARSHEET**  
By my troth, thou'lt set me a-weeping, an thou  
sayest so: prove that ever I dress myself handsome  
till thy return: well, harken at the end.

**FALSTAFF**  
Some sack, Francis.

**PRINCE HENRY & POINS**  
Anon, anon, sir.

*Coming forward*

**FALSTAFF**  
Ha! a bastard son of the king's? And art not thou  
Poins his brother?

**PRINCE HENRY**  
Why, thou globe of sinful continents! what a life  
dost thou lead!

**FALSTAFF**  
A better than thou: I am a gentleman; thou art a drawer.

**PRINCE HENRY**  
Very true, sir; and I come to draw you out by the ears.

**MISTRESS QUICKLY**  
O, the Lord preserve thy good grace! by my troth,  
welcome to London. Now, the Lord bless that sweet  
face of thine! O, Jesu, are you come from Wales?

**FALSTAFF**  
Thou whoreson mad compound of majesty, by this light  
flesh and corrupt blood, thou art welcome.

**PRINCE HENRY**  
You whoreson candle-mine, you, how vilely did you  
speak of me even now before this honest, virtuous,  
civil gentlewoman!

**MISTRESS QUICKLY**  
God's blessing of your good heart! and so she is,  
by my troth.

**FALSTAFF**  
Didst thou hear me?

**PRINCE HENRY**  
Yea, and you knew me, as you did when you ran away  
by Gad's-hill: you knew I was at your back, and  
spoke it on purpose to try my patience.

**FALSTAFF**  
No, no, no; not so; I did not think thou wast within hearing.

**PRINCE HENRY**  
I shall drive you then to confess the wilful abuse;  
and then I know how to handle you.

**FALSTAFF**  
No abuse, Hal, o' mine honour, no abuse.

**PRINCE HENRY**  
Not to dispraise me, and call me pantier and  
bread-chipper and I know not what?

**FALSTAFF**  
No abuse, Hal.

**POINS**  
No abuse?

**FALSTAFF**  
No abuse, Ned, i' the world; honest Ned, none. I  
dispraised him before the wicked, that the wicked  
might not fall in love with him; in which doing, I  
have done the part of a careful friend and a true  
subject, and thy father is to give me thanks for it.  
No abuse, Hal: none, Ned, none: no, faith, boys, none.

**PRINCE HENRY**  
See now, whether pure fear and entire cowardice doth  
not make thee wrong this virtuous gentlewoman to  
close with us? is she of the wicked? is thine  
hostess here of the wicked? or honest Bardolph,  
whose zeal burns in his nose, of the wicked?

**POINS**  
Answer, thou dead elm, answer.

**FALSTAFF**  
The fiend hath pricked down Bardolph irrecoverable;  
and his face is Lucifer's privy-kitchen, where he  
doth nothing but roast malt-worms.

**PRINCE HENRY**  
For the women?

**FALSTAFF**  
For one of them, she is in hell already, and burns  
poor souls. For the other, I owe her money, and  
whether she be damned for that, I know not.

**MISTRESS QUICKLY**  
No, I warrant you.

**FALSTAFF**  
No, I think thou art not; I think thou art quit for  
that. Marry, there is another indictment upon thee,  
for suffering flesh to be eaten in thy house,  
contrary to the law; for the which I think thou wilt howl.

**MISTRESS QUICKLY**  
All victuallers do so; what's a joint of mutton or  
two in a whole Lent?

*Knocking within*

Who knocks so loud at door? Look to the door there, Bardolph.

*Enter PETO*

**PRINCE HENRY**  
Peto, how now! what news?

**PETO**  
The king your father is at Westminster:  
And there are twenty weak and wearied posts  
Come from the north: and, as I came along,  
I met and overtook a dozen captains,  
Bare-headed, sweating, knocking at the taverns,  
And asking every one for Sir John Falstaff.

**PRINCE HENRY**  
By heaven, Poins, I feel me much to blame,  
So idly to profane the precious time,  
When tempest of commotion, like the south  
Borne with black vapour, doth begin to melt  
And drop upon our bare unarmed heads.  
Give me my sword and cloak. Falstaff, good night.

*Exeunt PRINCE HENRY, POINS, PETO and BARDOLPH*

**FALSTAFF**  
Now comes in the sweetest morsel of the night, and  
we must hence and leave it unpicked.

*Knocking within*

More knocking at the door!

*Re-enter BARDOLPH*

How now! what's the matter?

**BARDOLPH**  
You must away to court, sir, presently;  
A dozen captains stay at door for you.

**FALSTAFF**  
*\[To Bardolph]*  
Pay the musicians, sirrah. Farewell,  
hostess; farewell, Doll. You see, my good wenches,  
how men of merit are sought after: the undeserver  
may sleep, when the man of action is called on.  
Farewell good wenches: if I be not sent away post,  
I will see you again ere I go.

**DOLL TEARSHEET**  
I cannot speak; if my heart be not read to burst,--  
well, sweet Jack, have a care of thyself.

**FALSTAFF**  
Farewell, farewell.

*Exeunt FALSTAFF and BARDOLPH*

**MISTRESS QUICKLY**  
Well, fare thee well: I have known thee these  
twenty-nine years, come peascod-time; but an  
honester and truer-hearted man,--well, fare thee well.

*Exeunt*

## ACT III

### SCENE I. Westminster. The palace.

*Enter KING HENRY IV in his nightgown*

**KING HENRY IV**  
How many thousand of my poorest subjects  
Are at this hour asleep! O sleep, O gentle sleep,  
Nature's soft nurse, how have I frighted thee,  
That thou no more wilt weigh my eyelids down  
And steep my senses in forgetfulness?  
Why rather, sleep, liest thou in smoky cribs,  
Upon uneasy pallets stretching thee  
And hush'd with buzzing night-flies to thy slumber,  
Than in the perfumed chambers of the great,  
And lull'd with sound of sweetest melody?  
O thou dull god, why liest thou with the vile  
In loathsome beds, and leavest the kingly couch  
A watch-case or a common 'larum-bell?  
Wilt thou upon the high and giddy mast  
Seal up the ship-boy's eyes, and rock his brains  
In cradle of the rude imperious surge  
And in the visitation of the winds,  
Who take the ruffian billows by the top,  
Curling their monstrous heads and hanging them  
With deafening clamour in the slippery clouds,  
That, with the hurly, death itself awakes?  
Canst thou, O partial sleep, give thy repose  
To the wet sea-boy in an hour so rude,  
And in the calmest and most stillest night,  
Deny it to a king? Then happy low, lie down!  
Uneasy lies the head that wears a crown.

*Enter WARWICK*

**WARWICK**  
Many good morrows to your majesty!

**KING HENRY IV**  
Have you read o'er the letters that I sent you?

**WARWICK**  
I have, my liege.

**KING HENRY IV**  
Then you perceive the body of our kingdom  
How foul it is; what rank diseases grow  
And with what danger, near the heart of it.

**WARWICK**  
It is but as a body yet distemper'd;  
Which to his former strength may be restored  
With good advice and little medicine:  
My Lord Northumberland will soon be cool'd.

**KING HENRY IV**  
'Tis not 'ten years gone  
Since Richard and Northumberland, great friends,  
Did feast together, and in two years after  
Were they at wars: it is but eight years since  
This Percy was the man nearest my soul,  
Who like a brother toil'd in my affairs  
And laid his love and life under my foot,  
Yea, for my sake, even to the eyes of Richard  
Gave him defiance. But which of you was by--  
You, cousin Nevil, as I may remember--

*To WARWICK*

When Richard, with his eye brimful of tears,  
Then cheque'd and rated by Northumberland,  
Did speak these words, now proved a prophecy?  
'Northumberland, thou ladder by the which  
My cousin Bolingbroke ascends my throne;'  
Though then, God knows, I had no such intent,  
But that necessity so bow'd the state  
That I and greatness were compell'd to kiss:  
'The time shall come,' thus did he follow it,  
'The time will come, that foul sin, gathering head,  
Shall break into corruption:' so went on,  
Foretelling this same time's condition  
And the division of our amity.  
They say the bishop and Northumberland  
Are fifty thousand strong.

**WARWICK**  
It cannot be, my lord;  
Rumour doth double, like the voice and echo,  
The numbers of the fear'd. Please it your grace  
To go to bed. Upon my soul, my lord,  
The powers that you already have sent forth  
Shall bring this prize in very easily.  
To comfort you the more, I have received  
A certain instance that Glendower is dead.  
Your majesty hath been this fortnight ill,  
And these unseason'd hours perforce must add  
Unto your sickness.

**KING HENRY IV**  
I will take your counsel:  
And were these inward wars once out of hand,  
We would, dear lord, unto the Holy Land.

*Exeunt*

### SCENE II. Gloucestershire. Before SHALLOW'S house.

*Enter SHALLOW and SILENCE, meeting; MOULDY, WART, FEEBLE, and
BULLCALF.*

**SILENCE**  
Good morrow, good cousin Shallow.

**SHALLOW**  
A' must to the inns o' court shortly. I was  
once of Clement's Inn, where I think they will  
talk of mad Shallow yet.

**SILENCE**  
You were called 'lusty Shallow' then, cousin.

**SHALLOW**  
By the mass, I was called anything; and I would  
have done anything indeed too, and roundly too.  
There was I, and Jack Falstaff, now  
Sir John, a boy, and page to  
Thomas Mowbray, Duke of Norfolk.

**SILENCE**  
This Sir John, cousin, that comes hither anon about soldiers?

**SHALLOW**  
The same Sir John, the very same. I see him break  
Skogan's head at the court-gate, when a' was a  
crack not thus high: and the very same day did I  
fight with one Sampson Stockfish, a fruiterer,  
behind Gray's Inn. Jesu, Jesu, the mad days that I  
have spent! and to see how many of my old  
acquaintance are dead!

**SILENCE**  
We shall all follow, cousin.

**SHALLOW**  
Certain, 'tis certain; very sure, very sure: death,  
as the Psalmist saith, is certain to all; all shall  
die. Death is certain. Is old Double of your town living  
yet?

**SILENCE**  
Dead, sir.

**SHALLOW**  
Jesu, Jesu, dead! a' drew a good bow; and dead! a'  
shot a fine shoot: John a Gaunt loved him well, and  
betted much money on his head.

**SILENCE**  
Here come one of Sir John Falstaff's men, as I think.

*Enter BARDOLPH*

**BARDOLPH**  
Good morrow, honest gentlemen: I beseech you, which  
is Justice Shallow?

**SHALLOW**  
I am Robert Shallow, sir; a poor esquire of this  
county, and one of the king's justices of the peace.

**BARDOLPH**  
My captain, sir, commends him to you; my captain,  
Sir John Falstaff, a tall gentleman, by heaven, and  
a most gallant leader.

**SHALLOW**  
He greets me well, sir. I knew him a good backsword  
man. How doth the good knight? may I ask how my  
lady his wife doth?

**BARDOLPH**  
Sir, pardon; a soldier is better accommodated than  
with a wife.

**SHALLOW**  
It is well said, in faith, sir; and it is well said  
indeed too. Better accommodated! it is good; yea,  
indeed, is it: good phrases are surely, and ever  
were, very commendable. Accommodated! it comes of  
'accommodo' very good; a good phrase.

**BARDOLPH**  
Pardon me, sir; I have heard the word. Phrase call  
you it? by this good day, I know not the phrase;  
but I will maintain the word with my sword to be a  
soldier-like word, and a word of exceeding good  
command, by heaven. Accommodated; that is, when a  
man is, as they say, accommodated; or when a man is,  
being, whereby a' may be thought to be accommodated;  
which is an excellent thing.

**SHALLOW**  
It is very just.

*Enter FALSTAFF*

Welcome, good Sir John.

**FALSTAFF**  
I am glad to see you well, good Master Robert  
Shallow: Master Surecard, as I think?

**SHALLOW**  
No, Sir John; it is my cousin Silence, in commission with me.

**FALSTAFF**  
Good Master Silence, it well befits you should be of  
the peace.

**SILENCE**  
Your good-worship is welcome.

**FALSTAFF**  
Fie! this is hot weather, gentlemen. Have you  
provided me here sufficient men?

**SHALLOW**  
Marry, have we, sir. Will you sit?

**FALSTAFF**  
Let me see them, I beseech you.

**SHALLOW**  
Where's the roll? where's the roll? where's the  
roll? Let me see, let me see, let me see. So, so:  
yea, marry, sir: Ralph Mouldy! Let them appear as  
I call; let them do so, let them do so. Let me  
see; where is Mouldy?

**MOULDY**  
Here, an't please you.

**SHALLOW**  
What think you, Sir John? a good-limbed fellow;  
young, strong, and of good friends.

**FALSTAFF**  
Is thy name Mouldy?

**MOULDY**  
Yea, an't please you.

**FALSTAFF**  
'Tis the more time thou wert used. Prick him.

**MOULDY**  
I was pricked well enough before, an you could have  
let me alone: my old dame will be undone now for  
one to do her husbandry and her drudgery: you need  
not to have pricked me; there are other men fitter  
to go out than I.

**FALSTAFF**  
Go to: peace, Mouldy; you shall go. Mouldy, it is  
time you were spent.

**SHALLOW**  
Peace, fellow, peace; stand aside: know you where  
you are? For the other, Sir John: let me see:Francis Feeble!

**FEEBLE**  
Here, sir.

**FALSTAFF**  
What trade art thou, Feeble?

**FEEBLE**  
A woman's tailor, sir.

**SHALLOW**  
Shall I prick him, sir?

**FALSTAFF**  
You may: but if he had been a man's tailor, he'ld  
ha' pricked you. Wilt thou make as many holes in  
an enemy's battle as thou hast done in a woman's petticoat?

**FEEBLE**  
I will do my good will, sir; you can have no more.

**FALSTAFF**  
Well said, good woman's tailor! well said,  
courageous Feeble! thou wilt be as valiant as the  
wrathful dove or most magnanimous mouse. Prick the  
woman's tailor: well, Master Shallow; deep, Master Shallow.

**FEEBLE**  
I would Wart might have gone, sir.

**FALSTAFF**  
I would thou wert a man's tailor, that thou mightst  
mend him and make him fit to go. I cannot put him  
to a private soldier that is the leader of so many  
thousands: let that suffice, most forcible Feeble.

**FEEBLE**  
It shall suffice, sir.

**FALSTAFF**  
I am bound to thee, reverend Feeble. Who is next?

**SHALLOW**  
Peter Bullcalf o' the green!

**BULLCALF**  
Here, sir.

**FALSTAFF**  
'Fore God, a likely fellow! Come, prick me Bullcalf  
till he roar again.

**BULLCALF**  
O Lord! good my lord captain,--

**FALSTAFF**  
What, dost thou roar before thou art pricked?

**BULLCALF**  
O Lord, sir! I am a diseased man.

**FALSTAFF**  
What disease hast thou?

**BULLCALF**  
A whoreson cold, sir, a cough, sir, which I caught  
with ringing in the king's affairs upon his  
coronation-day, sir.

**FALSTAFF**  
Come, thou shalt go to the wars in a gown; we wilt  
have away thy cold; and I will take such order that  
my friends shall ring for thee. Is here all?

**SHALLOW**  
Here is one more called than your number, you must  
have but three here, sir: and so, I pray you, go in  
with me to dinner.

**FALSTAFF**  
Come, I will go drink with you, but I cannot tarry  
dinner. I am glad to see you, by my troth, Master Shallow.

*Exeunt FALSTAFF and Justices*

**BULLCALF**  
Good Master Corporate Bardolph, stand my friend;  
and here's four Harry ten shillings in French crowns  
for you. In very truth, sir, I had as lief be  
hanged, sir, as go: and yet, for mine own part, sir,  
I do not care; but rather, because I am unwilling,  
and, for mine own part, have a desire to stay with  
my friends; else, sir, I did not care, for mine own  
part, so much.

**BARDOLPH**  
Go to; stand aside.

**MOULDY**  
And, good master corporal captain, for my old  
dame's sake, stand my friend: she has nobody to do  
anything about her when I am gone; and she is old,  
and cannot help herself: You shall have forty, sir.

**BARDOLPH**  
Go to; stand aside.

**FEEBLE**  
By my troth, I care not; a man can die but once: we  
owe God a death: I'll ne'er bear a base mind:  
an't be my destiny, so; an't be not, so: no man is  
too good to serve's prince; and let it go which way  
it will, he that dies this year is quit for the next.

**BARDOLPH**  
Well said; thou'rt a good fellow.

*Re-enter FALSTAFF and the Justices*

**FALSTAFF**  
Come, sir, which men shall I have?

**SHALLOW**  
Three of which you please.

**BARDOLPH**  
Sir, a word with you: I have three pound to free  
Mouldy and Bullcalf.

**SHALLOW**  
Come, Sir John, which three will you have?

**FALSTAFF**  
Do you choose for me.

**SHALLOW**  
Marry, then, Mouldy, Bullcalf, and Feeble.

**FALSTAFF**  
Mouldy and Bullcalf: for you, Mouldy, stay at home  
till you are past service: and for your part,  
Bullcalf, grow till you come unto it: I will none of you.

**SHALLOW**  
Sir John, Sir John, do not yourself wrong: they are  
your likeliest men, and I would have you served with the best.

**FALSTAFF**  
Will you tell me, Master Shallow, how to choose a  
man? Care I for the limb, the thewes, the stature,  
bulk, and big assemblance of a man! Give me the  
spirit, Master Shallow. O, give me the spare men, and spare me the  
great ones. These fellows will do well, Master Shallow. God  
keep you, Master Silence: I will not use many words  
with you. Fare you well, gentlemen both: I thank  
you: I must a dozen mile to-night. Bardolph, give  
the soldier a coat.

**SHALLOW**  
Sir John, the Lord bless you! God prosper your  
affairs! God send us peace! At your return visit  
our house; let our old acquaintance be renewed;  
peradventure I will with ye to the court.

**FALSTAFF**  
'Fore God, I would you would, Master Shallow.

**SHALLOW**  
Go to; I have spoke at a word. God keep you.

**FALSTAFF**  
Fare you well, gentle gentlemen.

On, Bardolph; lead the man away.

*Exeunt*

##  INTERMISSION

## ACT IV

### SCENE I. Yorkshire. Gaultree Forest.

*Enter the ARCHBISHOP OF YORK, MOWBRAY, and HASTINGS*

*Enter a Captain*

**HASTINGS**  
Now, what news?

**Captain**  
West of this forest, scarcely off a mile,  
In goodly form comes on the enemy;  
And, by the ground they hide, I judge their number  
Upon or near the rate of thirty thousand.

**MOWBRAY**  
The just proportion that we gave them out  
Let us sway on and face them in the field.

**ARCHBISHOP OF YORK**  
What well-appointed leader fronts us here?

*Enter WESTMORELAND*

**WESTMORELAND**  
Health and fair greeting from our general,  
The prince, Lord John and Duke of Lancaster.

**ARCHBISHOP OF YORK**  
Say on, my Lady Westmoreland, in peace:  
What doth concern your coming?

**WESTMORELAND**  
Then, my lord,  
Unto your grace do I in chief address  
The substance of my speech.  
Wherefore do you so ill translate ourself  
Out of the speech of peace that bears such grace,  
Into the harsh and boisterous tongue of war;  
Turning your books to graves, your ink to blood,  
Your pens to lances and your tongue divine  
To a trumpet and a point of war?

**ARCHBISHOP OF YORK**  
We have the summary of all our griefs,  
When time shall serve, to show in articles;  
Which long ere this we offer'd to the king,  
And might by no suit gain our audience:  
When we are wrong'd and would unfold our griefs,  
We are denied access unto his person  
Even by those men that most have done us wrong.  
The dangers of the days but newly gone,  
Whose memory is written on the earth  
With yet appearing blood, and the examples  
Of every minute's instance, present now,  
Hath put us in these ill-beseeming arms,  
Not to break peace or any branch of it,  
But to establish here a peace indeed,  
Concurring both in name and quality.

**WESTMORELAND**  
Whenever yet was your appeal denied?  
Wherein have you been galled by the king?  
What peer hath been suborn'd to grate on you,  
That you should seal this lawless bloody book  
Of forged rebellion with a seal divine  
And consecrate commotion's bitter edge?

**ARCHBISHOP OF YORK**  
My brother general, the commonwealth,  
To brother born an household cruelty,  
I make my quarrel in particular.

**WESTMORELAND**  
There is no need of any such redress;  
Or if there were, it not belongs to you.

**MOWBRAY**  
Why not to him in part, and to us all  
That feel the bruises of the days before,  
And suffer the condition of these times  
To lay a heavy and unequal hand  
Upon our honours?

**WESTMORELAND**  
O, my good Lord Mowbray,  
Construe the times to their necessities,  
And you shall say indeed, it is the time,  
And not the king, that doth you injuries.  
Yet for your part, it not appears to me  
Either from the king or in the present time  
That you should have an inch of any ground  
To build a grief on: were you not restored  
To all the Duke of Norfolk's signories,  
Your noble and right well remember'd father's?

**MOWBRAY**  
What thing, in honour, had my father lost,  
That need to be revived and breathed in me?  
The king that loved him, as the state stood then,  
Was force perforce compell'd to banish him.

**WESTMORELAND**  
You speak, Lord Mowbray, now you know not what.  
Here come I from our princely general  
To know your griefs; to tell you from his grace  
That he will give you audience; and wherein  
It shall appear that your demands are just,  
You shall enjoy them, everything set off  
That might so much as think you enemies.

**ARCHBISHOP OF YORK**  
Then take, my Lord of Westmoreland, this schedule,  
For this contains our general grievances:  
Each several article herein redress'd,  
All members of our cause, both here and hence,  
That are insinew'd to this action,  
Acquitted by a true substantial form  
And present execution of our wills  
To us and to our purposes confined,  
We come within our awful banks again  
And knit our powers to the arm of peace.

**WESTMORELAND**  
This will I show the general. Please you, lords,  
In sight of both our battles we may meet;  
And either end in peace, which God so frame!  
Or to the place of difference call the swords  
Which must decide it.

**ARCHBISHOP OF YORK**  
My lord, we will do so.

*Exit WESTMORELAND*

**MOWBRAY**  
There is a thing within my bosom tells me  
That no conditions of our peace can stand.

**HASTINGS**  
Fear you not that: if we can make our peace  
Upon such large terms and so absolute  
As our conditions shall consist upon,  
Our peace shall stand as firm as rocky mountains.

**MOWBRAY**  
Yea, but our valuation shall be such  
That every slight and false-derived cause,  
Shall to the king taste of this action;  
That, were our royal faiths martyrs in love,  
We shall be winnow'd with so rough a wind  
That even our corn shall seem as light as chaff  
And good from bad find no partition.

**ARCHBISHOP OF YORK**  
No, no, my lord. Note this; the king is weary  
Of dainty and such picking grievances:  
For he hath found to end one doubt by death  
Revives two greater in the heirs of life,  
And therefore will he wipe his tables clean  
And keep no tell-tale to his memory  
That may repeat and history his loss  
To new remembrance; for full well he knows  
He cannot so precisely weed this land  
As his misdoubts present occasion:  
His foes are so enrooted with his friends  
That, plucking to unfix an enemy,  
He doth unfasten so and shake a friend:  
So that this land, like an offensive wife  
That hath enraged him on to offer strokes,  
As he is striking, holds his infant up  
And hangs resolved correction in the arm  
That was uprear'd to execution.

**HASTINGS**  
Besides, the king hath wasted all his rods  
On late offenders, that he now doth lack  
The very instruments of chastisement:  
So that his power, like to a fangless lion,  
May offer, but not hold.

**ARCHBISHOP OF YORK**  
And therefore be assured, my good lord marshal,  
If we do now make our atonement well,  
Our peace will, like a broken limb united,  
Grow stronger for the breaking.

**MOWBRAY**  
Be it so.  
Here is return'd my Lord of Westmoreland.

*Re-enter WESTMORELAND*

**WESTMORELAND**  
The prince is here at hand: pleaseth your lordship  
To meet his grace just distance 'tween our armies.

**MOWBRAY**  
Your grace of York, in God's name then, set forward.

**ARCHBISHOP OF YORK**  
Before, and greet his grace: my lord, we come.

*Exeunt*

### SCENE II. Another part of the forest.

*Enter, from one side, MOWBRAY, attended; afterwards the ARCHBISHOP OF YORK,
HASTINGS, and others: from the other side, Prince John of LANCASTER, and
WESTMORELAND; Officers, and others with them*

**LANCASTER**  
You are well encounter'd here, my cousin Mowbray:  
My Lord of York, it better show'd with you  
When that your flock, assembled by the bell,  
Encircled you to hear with reverence  
Your exposition on the holy text  
Than now to see you here an iron man,  
Cheering a rout of rebels with your drum,  
Turning the word to sword and life to death.  
You have ta'en up,  
The subjects of his substitute, my father,  
And both against the peace of heaven and him  
Have here up-swarm'd them.

**ARCHBISHOP OF YORK**  
Good my Lord of Lancaster,  
I am not here against your father's peace;  
But, as I told my lord of Westmoreland,  
The time misorder'd doth, in common sense,  
Crowd us and crush us to this monstrous form,  
To hold our safety up. I sent your grace  
The parcels and particulars of our grief,  
And true obedience, of this madness cured,  
Stoop tamely to the foot of majesty.

**MOWBRAY**  
If not, we ready are to try our fortunes  
To the last man.

**HASTINGS**  
And though we here fall down,  
We have supplies to second our attempt:  
If they miscarry, theirs shall second them;  
And so success of mischief shall be born  
And heir from heir shall hold this quarrel up  
Whiles England shall have generation.

**LANCASTER**  
You are too shallow, Hastings, much too shallow,  
To sound the bottom of the after-times.

**WESTMORELAND**  
Pleaseth your grace to answer them directly  
How far forth you do like their articles.

**LANCASTER**  
I like them all, and do allow them well,  
And swear here, by the honour of my blood,  
My father's purposes have been mistook,  
And some about him have too lavishly  
Wrested his meaning and authority.  
My lord, these griefs shall be with speed redress'd;  
Upon my soul, they shall. If this may please you,  
Discharge your powers unto their several counties,  
As we will ours: and here between the armies  
Let's drink together friendly and embrace,  
That all their eyes may bear those tokens home  
Of our restored love and amity.

**ARCHBISHOP OF YORK**  
I take your princely word for these redresses.

**LANCASTER**  
I give it you, and will maintain my word:  
And thereupon I drink unto your grace.

**HASTINGS**  
Go, captain, and deliver to the army  
This news of peace: let them have pay, and part:  
I know it will well please them. Hie thee, captain.

*Exit Captain*

**ARCHBISHOP OF YORK**  
To you, my noble Lord of Westmoreland.

**WESTMORELAND**  
I pledge your grace; and, if you knew what pains  
I have bestow'd to breed this present peace,  
You would drink freely: but my love to ye  
Shall show itself more openly hereafter.

**ARCHBISHOP OF YORK**  
I do not doubt you.

**WESTMORELAND**  
I am glad of it.  
Health to my lord and gentle cousin, Mowbray.

**MOWBRAY**  
You wish me health in very happy season;  
For I am, on the sudden, something ill.

**ARCHBISHOP OF YORK**  
Against ill chances men are ever merry;  
But heaviness foreruns the good event.

**WESTMORELAND**  
Therefore be merry, coz; since sudden sorrow  
Serves to say thus, 'some good thing comes  
to-morrow.'

*Shouts within*

**LANCASTER**  
The word of peace is render'd: hark, how they shout!

**MOWBRAY**  
This had been cheerful after victory.

**ARCHBISHOP OF YORK**  
A peace is of the nature of a conquest;  
For then both parties nobly are subdued,  
And neither party loser.

**LANCASTER**  
Go, my lord,  
And let our army be discharged too.

*Exit WESTMORELAND*

And, good my lord, so please you, let our trains  
March, by us, that we may peruse the men  
We should have coped withal.

**ARCHBISHOP OF YORK**  
Go, good Lord Hastings,  
And, ere they be dismissed, let them march by.

*Exit HASTINGS*

**LANCASTER**  
I trust, lords, we shall lie to-night together.

*Re-enter WESTMORELAND*

Now, cousin, wherefore stands our army still?

**WESTMORELAND**  
The leaders, having charge from you to stand,  
Will not go off until they hear you speak.

*Re-enter HASTINGS*

**HASTINGS**  
My lord, our army is dispersed already;  
Like youthful steers unyoked, they take their courses  
East, west, north, south; or, like a school broke up,  
Each hurries toward his home and sporting-place.

**WESTMORELAND**  
Good tidings, my Lord Hastings; for the which  
I do arrest thee, traitor, of high treason:  
And you, lord archbishop, and you, Lord Mowbray,  
Of capitol treason I attach you both.

**MOWBRAY**  
Is this proceeding just and honourable?

**WESTMORELAND**  
Is your assembly so?

**LANCASTER**  
I promised you redress of these same grievances  
Whereof you did complain; which, by mine honour,  
I will perform with a most Christian care.  
But for you, rebels, look to taste the due  
Meet for rebellion and such acts as yours.  
Most shallowly did you these arms commence,  
Fondly brought here and foolishly sent hence.  
Strike up our drums, pursue the scatter'd stray:  
God, and not we, hath safely fought to-day.  
Some guard these traitors to the block of death,  
Treason's true bed and yielder up of breath.

*Exeunt*

### SCENE III. Another part of the forest.

*Enter FALSTAFF from one side, PRINCE JOHN OF LANCASTER from the other*

**LANCASTER**  
Now, Falstaff, where have you been all this while?  
When everything is ended, then you come:  
These tardy tricks of yours will, on my life,  
One time or other break some gallows' back.

**FALSTAFF**  
I would be sorry, my lord, but it should be thus: I  
never knew yet but rebuke and cheque was the reward  
of valour. Do you think me a swallow, an arrow, or a  
bullet? have I, in my poor and old motion, the  
expedition of thought? I have speeded hither with  
the very extremest inch of possibility; I have  
foundered nine score and odd posts.

*Enter WESTMORELAND*

**LANCASTER**  
Now, have you left pursuit?

**WESTMORELAND**  
Retreat is made and execution stay'd.

**LANCASTER**  
Then now dispatch we toward the court, my lords:  
I hear the king my father is sore sick:  
Our news shall go before us to his majesty,  
Which, cousin, you shall bear to comfort him,  
And we with sober speed will follow you.

**FALSTAFF**  
My lord, I beseech you, give me leave to go  
Through Gloucestershire: and, when you come to court,  
Stand my good lord, pray, in your good report.

**LANCASTER**  
Fare you well, Falstaff: I, in my condition,  
Shall better speak of you than you deserve.

*Exeunt all but Falstaff*

**FALSTAFF**  
I would you had but the wit: 'twere better than  
your dukedom. Good faith, this same young sober-  
blooded boy doth not love me; nor a man cannot make  
him laugh; but that's no marvel, he drinks no wine.  
There's never none of these demure boys come to any  
proof; for thin drink doth so over-cool their blood,  
and making many fish-meals, that they fall into a  
kind of male green-sickness; and then when they  
marry, they get wenches: they are generally fools  
and cowards; which some of us should be too, but for  
inflammation. A good sherris sack hath a two-fold  
operation in it. It ascends me into the brain;  
dries me there all the foolish and dull and curdy  
vapours which environ it; makes it apprehensive,  
quick, forgetive, full of nimble fiery and  
delectable shapes, which, delivered o'er to the  
voice, the tongue, which is the birth, becomes  
excellent wit. The second property of your  
excellent sherris is, the warming of the blood;  
which, before cold and settled, left the liver  
white and pale, which is the badge of pusillanimity  
and cowardice; but the sherris warms it and makes  
it course from the inwards to the parts extreme:  
it illumineth the face, which as a beacon gives  
warning to all the rest of this little kingdom,  
man, to arm; and then the vital commoners and  
inland petty spirits muster me all to their captain,  
the heart, who, great and puffed up with this  
retinue, doth any deed of courage; and this valour  
comes of sherris. So that skill in the weapon is  
nothing without sack, for that sets it a-work; and  
learning a mere hoard of gold kept by a devil, till  
sack commences it and sets it in act and use.  
Hereof comes it that Prince Harry is valiant; for  
the cold blood he did naturally inherit of his  
father, he hath, like lean, sterile and bare land,  
manured, husbanded and tilled with excellent  
endeavour of drinking good and good store of fertile  
sherris, that he is become very hot and valiant. If  
I had a thousand sons, the first humane principle I  
would teach them should be, to forswear thin  
potations and to addict themselves to sack.

*Enter BARDOLPH*

How now Bardolph?

**BARDOLPH**  
The army is discharged all and gone.

**FALSTAFF**  
Let them go. I'll through Gloucestershire; and  
there will I visit Master Robert Shallow, esquire:  
I have him already tempering between my finger and  
my thumb, and shortly will I seal with him. Come away.

*Exeunt*

### SCENE IV. Westminster. The Jerusalem Chamber.

*Enter KING HENRY IV, the Princes Thomas of CLARENCE and Humphrey of
GLOUCESTER, and WARWICK*

**KING HENRY IV**  
Now, lords, if God doth give successful end  
To this debate that bleedeth at our doors,  
We will our youth lead on to higher fields  
And draw no swords but what are sanctified.  
Our navy is address'd, our power collected,  
Our substitutes in absence well invested,  
And everything lies level to our wish:  
Only, we want a little personal strength;  
And pause us, till these rebels, now afoot,  
Come underneath the yoke of government.

**WARWICK**  
Both which we doubt not but your majesty  
Shall soon enjoy.

**KING HENRY IV**  
Humphrey, my son of Gloucester,  
Where is the prince your brother?

**GLOUCESTER**  
I think he's gone to hunt, my lord, at Windsor.

**KING HENRY IV**  
Is not his brother, Thomas of Clarence, with him?

**GLOUCESTER**  
No, my good lord; he is in presence here.

**CLARENCE**  
What would my lord and father?

**KING HENRY IV**  
Nothing but well to thee, Thomas of Clarence.  
How chance thou art not with the prince thy brother?  
He loves thee, and thou dost neglect him, Thomas;  
Thou hast a better place in his affection  
Than all thy brothers: cherish it, my boy,  
And noble offices thou mayst effect  
Of mediation, after I am dead,  
Between his greatness and thy other brethren:  
Therefore omit him not; blunt not his love,  
Nor lose the good advantage of his grace  
By seeming cold or careless of his will;  
For he is gracious, if he be observed.

**CLARENCE**  
I shall observe him with all care and love.

**KING HENRY IV**  
Why art thou not at Windsor with him, Thomas?

**CLARENCE**  
He is not there today; he dines in London.

**KING HENRY IV**  
And how accompanied? canst thou tell that?

**CLARENCE**  
With Poins, and other his continual followers.

**KING HENRY IV**  
Most subject is the fattest soil to weeds;  
And he, the noble image of my youth,  
Is overspread with them: therefore my grief  
Stretches itself beyond the hour of death:  
The blood weeps from my heart when I do shape  
In forms imaginary the unguided days  
And rotten times that you shall look upon  
When I am sleeping with my ancestors.  
For when his headstrong riot hath no curb,  
When means and lavish manners meet together,  
O, with what wings shall his affections fly  
Towards fronting peril and opposed decay!

**WARWICK**  
My gracious lord, you look beyond him quite:  
The prince but studies his companions  
Like a strange tongue, wherein, to gain the language,  
'Tis needful that the most immodest word  
Be look'd upon and learn'd; which once attain'd,  
Your highness knows, comes to no further use  
But to be known and hated. So, like gross terms,  
The prince will in the perfectness of time  
Cast off his followers; and their memory  
Shall as a pattern or a measure live,  
By which his grace must mete the lives of others,  
Turning past evils to advantages.

**KING HENRY IV**  
'Tis seldom when the bee doth leave her comb  
In the dead carrion.

*Enter WESTMORELAND*

**WESTMORELAND**  
Health to my sovereign, and new happiness  
Added to that that I am to deliver!  
Prince John your son doth kiss your grace's hand:  
Mowbray, the Bishop Scroop, Hastings and all  
Are brought to the correction of your law;  
There is not now a rebel's sword unsheath'd  
But peace puts forth her olive everywhere.  
The manner how this action hath been borne  
Here at more leisure may your highness read,  
With every course in his particular.

**KING HENRY IV**  
O Westmoreland, thou art a summer bird,  
Which ever in the haunch of winter sings  
The lifting up of day. What? There's more news

**WESTMORELAND**  
From enemies heaven keep your majesty;  
And, when they stand against you, may they fall  
As those that I am come to tell you of!  
The Earl Northumberland and the Lord Bardolph,  
With a great power of English and of Scots  
Are by the sheriff of Yorkshire overthrown.

**KING HENRY IV**  
And wherefore should these good news make me sick?  
Will fortune never come with both hands full,  
But write her fair words still in foulest letters?  
She either gives a stomach and no food;  
Such are the poor, in health; or else a feast  
And takes away the stomach; such are the rich,  
That have abundance and enjoy it not.  
I should rejoice now at this happy news;  
And now my sight fails, and my brain is giddy:  
O me! come near me; now I am much ill.

**GLOUCESTER**  
Comfort, your majesty!

**CLARENCE**  
No, no, he cannot long hold out these pangs:  
The incessant care and labour of his mind  
Hath wrought the mure that should confine it in  
So thin that life looks through and will break out.

**GLOUCESTER**  
The people fear me; for they do observe  
Unfather'd heirs and loathly births of nature:  
The seasons change their manners, as the year  
Had found some months asleep and leap'd them over.

**CLARENCE**  
The river hath thrice flow'd, no ebb between;  
And the old folk, time's doting chronicles,  
Say it did so a little time before  
That our great-grandsire, Edward, sick'd and died.

**WARWICK**  
Speak lower, princes, for the king recovers.

**GLOUCESTER**  
This apoplexy will certain be his end.

**KING HENRY IV**  
I pray you, take me up, and bear me hence  
Into some other chamber: softly, pray.

### SCENE V. Another chamber.

*KING HENRY IV lying on a bed: CLARENCE, GLOUCESTER, and WARWICK in
attendance.*

**KING HENRY IV**  
Let there be no noise made, my gentle friends;  
Unless some dull and favourable hand  
Will whisper music to my weary spirit.

**WARWICK**  
Call for the music in the other room.

**KING HENRY IV**  
Set me the crown upon my pillow here.

**CLARENCE**  
His eye is hollow, and he changes much.

**WARWICK**  
Less noise, less noise!

*Enter PRINCE HENRY*

**PRINCE HENRY**  
How now! rain within doors, and none abroad!  
How doth the king? /

**GLOUCESTER**  
/ Exceeding ill.

**PRINCE HENRY**  
Heard he the good news yet?  
Tell it him. /

**GLOUCESTER**  
/ He alter'd much upon the hearing it.

**PRINCE HENRY**  
If he be sick with joy, he'll recover without physic.

**WARWICK**  
Not so much noise, my lords: sweet prince, speak low;  
The king your father is disposed to sleep.

**CLARENCE**  
Let us withdraw into the other room.

**PRINCE HENRY**  
No; I will sit and watch here by the king.

*Exeunt all but PRINCE HENRY*

Why doth the crown lie there upon his pillow,  
Being so troublesome a bedfellow?  
O polish'd perturbation! golden care!  
That keep'st the ports of slumber open wide  
To many a watchful night! sleep with it now!  
Yet not so sound and half so deeply sweet  
As he whose brow with homely biggen bound  
Snores out the watch of night. O majesty!  
When thou dost pinch thy bearer, thou dost sit  
Like a rich armour worn in heat of day,  
That scalds with safety. By his gates of breath  
There lies a downy feather which stirs not:  
Did he suspire, that light and weightless down  
Perforce must move. My gracious lord! my father!  
This sleep is sound indeed, this is a sleep  
That from this golden rigol hath divorced  
So many English kings. Thy due from me  
Is tears and heavy sorrows of the blood,  
Which nature, love, and filial tenderness,  
Shall, O dear father, pay thee plenteously:  
My due from thee is this imperial crown,  
Which, as immediate as thy place and blood,  
Derives itself to me. Lo, here it sits,  
Which God shall guard: and put the world's whole strength  
Into one giant arm, it shall not force  
This lineal honour from me: this from thee  
Will I to mine leave, as 'tis left to me.

*Exit*

**KING HENRY IV**  
Warwick! Gloucester! Clarence!

*Re-enter WARWICK, GLOUCESTER, and CLARENCE*

**CLARENCE**  
Doth the king call?

**WARWICK**  
What would your majesty? How fares your grace?

**KING HENRY IV**  
Why did you leave me here alone, my lords?

**CLARENCE**  
We left the prince my brother here, my liege,  
Who undertook to sit and watch by you.

**KING HENRY IV**  
The Prince of Wales! Where is he? let me see him:  
He is not here.

**WARWICK**  
This door is open; he is gone this way.

**GLOUCESTER**  
He came not through the chamber where we stay'd.

**KING HENRY IV**  
Where is the crown? who took it from my pillow?

**WARWICK**  
When we withdrew, my liege, we left it here.

**KING HENRY IV**  
The prince hath ta'en it hence: go, seek him out.  
Is he so hasty that he doth suppose  
My sleep my death?  
Find him, my Lord of Warwick; chide him hither.

*Exit WARWICK*

This part of his conjoins with my disease,  
And helps to end me. See, sons, what things you are!  
How quickly nature falls into revolt  
When gold becomes her object!  
For this the foolish over-careful fathers  
Have broke their sleep with thoughts, their brains with care,  
Their bones with industry;  
For this they have engrossed and piled up  
The canker'd heaps of strange-achieved gold;  
For this they have been thoughtful to invest  
Their sons with arts and martial exercises!

*Re-enter WARWICK*

Now, where is he that will not stay so long  
Till his friend sickness hath determined me?

**WARWICK**  
My lord, I found the prince in the next room,  
Washing with kindly tears his gentle cheeks,  
With such a deep demeanor in great sorrow  
That tyranny, which never quaff'd but blood,  
Would, by beholding him, have wash'd his knife  
With gentle eye-drops. He is coming hither.

**KING HENRY IV**  
But wherefore did he take away the crown?

*Re-enter PRINCE HENRY*

Lo, where he comes. Come hither to me, Harry.  
Depart the chamber, leave us here alone.

*Exeunt WARWICK and the rest*

**PRINCE HENRY**  
I never thought to hear you speak again.

**KING HENRY IV**  
Thy wish was father, Harry, to that thought:  
I stay too long by thee, I weary thee.  
Dost thou so hunger for mine empty chair  
That thou wilt needs invest thee with my honours  
Before thy hour be ripe? O foolish youth!  
Thou seek'st the greatness that will o'erwhelm thee.  
Stay but a little; for my cloud of dignity  
Is held from falling with so weak a wind  
That it will quickly drop: my day is dim.  
Thou hast stolen that which after some few hours  
Were thine without offence; and at my death  
Thou hast seal'd up my expectation:  
Thy life did manifest thou lovedst me not,  
And thou wilt have me die assured of it.  
Thou hidest a thousand daggers in thy thoughts,  
Which thou hast whetted on thy stony heart,  
To stab at half an hour of my life.  
What! canst thou not forbear me half an hour?  
Then get thee gone and dig my grave thyself,  
And bid the merry bells ring to thine ear  
That thou art crowned, not that I am dead.  
Let all the tears that should bedew my hearse  
Be drops of balm to sanctify thy head:  
Only compound me with forgotten dust  
Give that which gave thee life unto the worms.  
Pluck down my officers, break my decrees;  
For now a time is come to mock at form:  
Harry the Fifth is crown'd: up, vanity!  
Down, royal state! all you sage counsellors, hence!  
And to the English court assemble now,  
From every region, apes of idleness!  
Now, neighbour confines, purge you of your scum:  
Have you a ruffian that will swear, drink, dance,  
Revel the night, rob, murder, and commit  
The oldest sins the newest kind of ways?  
Be happy, he will trouble you no more;  
England shall double gild his treble guilt,  
England shall give him office, honour, might;  
For the fifth Harry from curb'd licence plucks  
The muzzle of restraint, and the wild dog  
Shall flesh his tooth on every innocent.  
O my poor kingdom, sick with civil blows!  
When that my care could not withhold thy riots,  
What wilt thou do when riot is thy care?  
O, thou wilt be a wilderness again,  
Peopled with wolves, thy old inhabitants!

**PRINCE HENRY**  
O, pardon me, my liege! but for my tears,  
The moist impediments unto my speech,  
I had forestall'd this dear and deep rebuke  
Ere you with grief had spoke and I had heard  
The course of it so far. There is your crown;  
And He that wears the crown immortally  
Long guard it yours! If I affect it more  
Than as your honour and as your renown,  
Let me no more from this obedience rise,  
Which my most inward true and duteous spirit  
Teacheth, this prostrate and exterior bending.  
God witness with me, when I here came in,  
And found no course of breath within your majesty,  
How cold it struck my heart! If I do feign,  
O, let me in my present wildness die  
And never live to show the incredulous world  
The noble change that I have purposed!  
Coming to look on you, thinking you dead,  
And dead almost, my liege, to think you were,  
I spake unto this crown as having sense,  
And thus upbraided it: 'The care on thee depending  
Hath fed upon the body of my father;  
Therefore, thou best of gold art worst of gold:  
Other, less fine in carat, is more precious,  
Preserving life in medicine potable;  
But thou, most fine, most honour'd: most renown'd,  
Hast eat thy bearer up.' Thus, my most royal liege,  
Accusing it, I put it on my head,  
To try with it, as with an enemy  
That had before my face murder'd my father,  
The quarrel of a true inheritor.  
But if it did infect my blood with joy,  
Or swell my thoughts to any strain of pride;  
If any rebel or vain spirit of mine  
Did with the least affection of a welcome  
Give entertainment to the might of it,  
Let God for ever keep it from my head  
And make me as the poorest vassal is  
That doth with awe and terror kneel to it!

**KING HENRY IV**  
O my son,  
God put it in thy mind to take it hence,  
That thou mightst win the more thy father's love,  
Pleading so wisely in excuse of it!  
Come hither, Harry, sit thou by my bed;  
And hear, I think, the very latest counsel  
That ever I shall breathe. God knows, my son,  
By what by-paths and indirect crook'd ways  
I met this crown; and I myself know well  
How troublesome it sat upon my head.  
To thee it shall descend with bitter quiet,  
Better opinion, better confirmation;  
For all the soil of the achievement goes  
With me into the earth. It seem'd in me  
But as an honour snatch'd with boisterous hand,  
And I had many living to upbraid  
My gain of it by their assistances;  
Which daily grew to quarrel and to bloodshed,  
Wounding supposed peace: all these bold fears  
Thou see'st with peril I have answered;  
For all my reign hath been but as a scene  
Acting that argument: and now my death  
Changes the mode; for what in me was purchased,  
Falls upon thee in a more fairer sort;  
So thou the garland wear'st successively.  
Yet, though thou stand'st more sure than I could do,  
Thou art not firm enough, since griefs are green;  
And all my friends, which thou must make thy friends,  
Have but their stings and teeth newly ta'en out;  
By whose fell working I was first advanced  
And by whose power I well might lodge a fear  
To be again displaced: which to avoid,  
I cut them off; and had a purpose now  
To lead out many to the Holy Land,  
Lest rest and lying still might make them look  
Too near unto my state. Therefore, my Harry,  
Be it thy course to busy giddy minds  
With foreign quarrels; that action, hence borne out,  
May waste the memory of the former days.  
More would I, but my lungs are wasted so  
That strength of speech is utterly denied me.  
How I came by the crown, O God forgive;  
And grant it may with thee in true peace live!

**PRINCE HENRY**  
My gracious liege,  
You won it, wore it, kept it, gave it me;  
Then plain and right must my possession be:  
Which I with more than with a common pain  
'Gainst all the world will rightfully maintain.

*Enter Lord John of LANCASTER*

**KING HENRY IV**  
Look, look, here comes my John of Lancaster.

**LANCASTER**  
Health, peace, and happiness to my royal father!

**KING HENRY IV**  
Thou bring'st me happiness and peace, son John;  
But health, alack, with youthful wings is flown  
From this bare wither'd trunk: upon thy sight  
My worldly business makes a period.  
Where is my Lord of Warwick?

*Enter WARWICK*

Doth any name particular belong  
Unto the lodging where I first did swoon?

**WARWICK**  
'Tis call'd Jerusalem, my noble lord.

**KING HENRY IV**  
Laud be to God! even there my life must end.  
It hath been prophesied to me many years,  
I should not die but in Jerusalem;  
Which vainly I supposed the Holy Land:  
But bear me to that chamber; there I'll lie;  
In that Jerusalem shall Harry die.

*Exeunt*

## ACT V

### SCENE I. Gloucestershire. SHALLOW'S house.

*Enter SHALLOW, FALSTAFF, BARDOLPH, and Page*

**SHALLOW**  
By cock and pie, sir, you shall not away to-night.  
What, Davy, I say!

**FALSTAFF**  
You must excuse me, Master Robert Shallow.

**SHALLOW**  
I will not excuse you; you shall not be excused;  
excuses shall not be admitted; there is no excuse  
shall serve; you shall not be excused. Why, Davy!

*Enter DAVY*

**DAVY**  
Here, sir.

**SHALLOW**  
Davy, Davy, Davy, Davy, let me see, Davy; let me  
see, Davy; let me see: Some pigeons, Davy, a couple  
of short-legged hens, a joint of mutton, and any  
pretty little tiny kickshaws, tell William cook.

**DAVY**  
Doth the man of war stay all night, sir?

**SHALLOW**  
Yea, Davy. I will use him well: a friend i' the  
court is better than a penny in purse. Use his men  
well, Davy; for they are arrant knaves, and will backbite.

**DAVY**  
No worse than they are backbitten, sir; for they  
have marvellous foul linen.

**SHALLOW**  
Well conceited, Davy: about thy business, Davy.

*Exit DAVY*

Where are you, Sir John? Come, come, come, off  
with your boots. Give me your hand, Master Bardolph.

**BARDOLPH**  
I am glad to see your worship.

**SHALLOW**  
I thank thee with all my heart, kind  
Master Bardolph: and welcome, my tall fellow.

Come, Sir John.

**FALSTAFF**  
I'll follow you, good Master Robert Shallow.

*Exit SHALLOW*

Bardolph, look to our horses.

*Exeunt BARDOLPH*

**SHALLOW**  
If I were sawed into quantities, I should make four  
dozen of such bearded hermits' staves as Master  
Shallow. It is a wonderful thing to see the  
semblable coherence of his men's spirits and his:  
they, by observing of him, do bear themselves like  
foolish justices; he, by conversing with them, is  
turned into a justice-like serving-man: their  
spirits are so married in conjunction with the  
participation of society that they flock together in  
consent, like so many wild-geese.  
I will devise matter enough out of this Shallow to  
keep Prince Harry in continual laughter the wearing  
out of six fashions, which is four terms, or two  
actions, and a' shall laugh without intervallums. O,  
it is much that a lie with a slight oath and a jest  
with a sad brow will do with a fellow that never  
had the ache in his shoulders! O, you shall see him  
laugh till his face be like a wet cloak ill laid up!

**SHALLOW**  
*\[Within]*  
Sir John!

**FALSTAFF**  
I come, Master Shallow; I come, Master Shallow.

*Exit*

### SCENE II. Westminster. The palace.

*Enter WARWICK and the Lord Chief-Justice, meeting*

**WARWICK**  
How now, my lord chief-justice! whither away?

**Lord Chief-Justice**  
How doth the king?

**WARWICK**  
Exceeding well; his cares are now all ended.

He's walk'd the way of nature;  
And to our purposes he lives no more.

**Lord Chief-Justice**  
I would his majesty had call'd me with him:  
The service that I truly did his life  
Hath left me open to all injuries.

**WARWICK**  
Indeed I think the young king loves you not.

**Lord Chief-Justice**  
I know he doth not, and do arm myself  
To welcome the condition of the time,  
Which cannot look more hideously upon me  
Than I have drawn it in my fantasy.

*Enter KING HENRY V, LANCASTER, CLARENCE, and GLOUCESTER*

**Lord Chief-Justice**  
Good morrow; and God save your majesty!

**KING HENRY V**  
This new and gorgeous garment, majesty,  
Sits not so easy on me as you think.  
Brothers, you mix your sadness with some fear:  
This is the English, not the Turkish court;  
Not Amurath an Amurath succeeds,  
But Harry Harry. Yet be sad, good brothers,  
For, by my faith, it very well becomes you:  
Sorrow so royally in you appears  
That I will deeply put the fashion on  
And wear it in my heart: why then, be sad;  
But entertain no more of it, good brothers,  
Than a joint burden laid upon us all.  
For me, by heaven, I bid you be assured,  
I'll be your father and your brother too;  
Let me but bear your love, I 'll bear your cares:  
Yet weep that Harry's dead; and so will I;  
But Harry lives, that shall convert those tears  
By number into hours of happiness.

**CLARENCE**  
We hope no other from your majesty.

**KING HENRY V**  
You all look strangely on me: and you most;  
You are, I think, assured I love you not.

**Lord Chief-Justice**  
I am assured, if I be measured rightly,  
Your majesty hath no just cause to hate me.

**KING HENRY V**  
No!  
How might a prince of my great hopes forget  
So great indignities you laid upon me?  
What! rate, rebuke, and roughly send to prison  
The immediate heir of England! Was this easy?

**Lord Chief-Justice**  
I then did use the person of your father;  
The image of his power lay then in me:  
And, in the administration of his law,  
Your highness pleased to forget my place,  
The majesty and power of law and justice,  
The image of the king whom I presented,  
And struck me in my very seat of judgment;  
Whereon, as an offender to your father,  
I gave bold way to my authority  
And did commit you. If the deed were ill,  
Be you contented, wearing now the garland,  
To have a son set your decrees at nought,  
To pluck down justice from your awful bench,  
To trip the course of law and blunt the sword  
That guards the peace and safety of your person;  
Nay, more, to spurn at your most royal image  
And mock your workings in a second body.  
Question your royal thoughts, make the case yours;  
Be now the father and propose a son,  
Hear your own dignity so much profaned,  
See your most dreadful laws so loosely slighted,  
Behold yourself so by a son disdain'd;  
And then imagine me taking your part  
And in your power soft silencing your son:  
After this cold considerance, sentence me;  
And, as you are a king, speak in your state  
What I have done that misbecame my place,  
My person, or my liege's sovereignty.

**KING HENRY V**  
You are right, justice, and you weigh this well;  
Therefore still bear the balance and the sword:  
And I do wish your honours may increase,  
Till you do live to see a son of mine  
Offend you and obey you, as I did.  
And, princes all, believe me, I beseech you;  
My father is gone wild into his grave,  
For in his tomb lie my affections;  
And with his spirit sadly I survive,  
To mock the expectation of the world,  
To frustrate prophecies and to raze out  
Rotten opinion, who hath writ me down  
After my seeming. The tide of blood in me  
Hath proudly flow'd in vanity till now:  
Now doth it turn and ebb back to the sea,  
Where it shall mingle with the state of floods  
And flow henceforth in formal majesty.  
Now call we our high court of parliament:  
And let us choose such limbs of noble counsel,  
That the great body of our state may go  
In equal rank with the best govern'd nation;  
That war, or peace, or both at once, may be  
As things acquainted and familiar to us;  
In which you, father, shall have foremost hand.  
Our coronation done, we will accite,  
As I before remember'd, all our state:  
And, God consigning to my good intents,  
No prince nor peer shall have just cause to say,  
God shorten Harry's happy life one day!

*Exeunt*

### SCENE III. Gloucestershire. SHALLOW'S orchard.

*Enter FALSTAFF, SHALLOW, SILENCE, DAVY, and BARDOLPH*

**FALSTAFF**  
Health and long life to you, Master Silence.

**SILENCE**  
Fill the cup, and let it come;

*Singing*

I'll pledge you a mile to the bottom.

*Knocking within*

**SHALLOW**  
Look who's at door there, ho! who knocks?

*Exit DAVY*

**FALSTAFF**  
Why, now you have done me right.

*To SILENCE, seeing him take off a bumper*

**SILENCE**  
*\[Singing]*  
Do me right,  
And dub me knight: Samingo.  
Is't not so?

**FALSTAFF**  
'Tis so.

*Re-enter DAVY*

**DAVY**  
An't please your worship, there's one Pistol come  
from the court with news.

**FALSTAFF**  
From the court! let him come in.

*Enter PISTOL*

How now, Pistol!

What wind blew you hither, Pistol?

**PISTOL**  
Not the ill wind which blows no man to good. Sweet  
knight, thou art now one of the greatest men in this realm.

**SILENCE**  
By'r lady, I think a' be, but goodman Puff of Barson.

**PISTOL**  
Puff!  
Puff in thy teeth, most recreant coward base!

*Exit SILENCE*

Sir John, I am thy Pistol and thy friend,  
And helter-skelter have I rode to thee,  
And tidings do I bring and lucky joys  
And golden times and happy news of price.

**FALSTAFF**  
I pray thee now, deliver them like a man of this world.

**SHALLOW**  
Give me pardon, sir: if, sir, you come with news  
from the court, I take it there's but two ways,  
either to utter them, or to conceal them. I am,  
sir, under the king, in some authority.

**PISTOL**  
Under which king, Besonian? speak, or die.

**SHALLOW**  
Under King Harry.

**PISTOL**  
Harry the Fourth? or Fifth?

**SHALLOW**  
Harry the Fourth.

**PISTOL**  
A foutre for thine office!  
Sir John, thy tender lambkin now is king;  
Harry the Fifth's the man. I speak the truth:  
When Pistol lies, do this; and fig me, like  
The bragging Spaniard.

**FALSTAFF**  
What, is the old king dead?

**PISTOL**  
As nail in door: the things I speak are just.

**FALSTAFF**  
Away, Bardolph! saddle my horse. Master Robert  
Shallow, choose what office thou wilt in the land,  
'tis thine. Pistol, I will double-charge thee with dignities.

**BARDOLPH**  
O joyful day!  
I would not take a knighthood for my fortune.

**FALSTAFF**  
Master Shallow, my  
Lord Shallow,--be what thou wilt; I am fortune's  
steward--get on thy boots: we'll ride all night.  
O sweet Pistol! Away, Bardolph!

*Exeunt all but FALSTAFF and PISTOL*

Come, Pistol, utter more to me; and withal devise  
something to do thyself good. Boot, boot, Master  
Shallow: I know the young king is sick for me. Let  
us take any man's horses; the laws of England are at  
my commandment. Blessed are they that have been my  
friends; and woe to my lord chief-justice!

**PISTOL**  
Let vultures vile seize on his lungs also!  
'Where is the life that late I led?' say they:  
Why, here it is; welcome these pleasant days!

*Exeunt*

### SCENE IV. London. A street.

*Enter an Officer, dragging in HOSTESS QUICKLY and DOLL TEARSHEET*

**MISTRESS QUICKLY**  
No, thou arrant knave; I would to God that I might  
die, that I might have thee hanged: thou hast  
drawn my shoulder out of joint.

**Officer**  
The constables have delivered her over to me; and  
she shall have whipping-cheer enough, I warrant  
her: there hath been a man or two lately killed about her.

**DOLL TEARSHEET**  
Nut-hook, nut-hook, you lie. Come on; I 'll tell  
thee what, thou damned tripe-visaged rascal, an  
the child I now go with do miscarry, thou wert  
better thou hadst struck thy mother, thou  
paper-faced villain.

**MISTRESS QUICKLY**  
O the Lord, that Sir John were come! he would make  
this a bloody day to somebody. But I pray God the  
fruit of her womb miscarry!

**Officer**  
If it do, you shall have a dozen of cushions again;  
you have but eleven now. Come, I charge you both go  
with me; for the man is dead that you and Pistol  
beat amongst you.

**DOLL TEARSHEET**  
I'll tell you what, you thin man in a censer, I  
will have you as soundly swinged for this,--you  
blue-bottle rogue, you filthy famished correctioner,  
if you be not swinged, I'll forswear half-kirtles.

**Officer**  
Come, come, you she knight-errant, come.

**MISTRESS QUICKLY**  
O God, that right should thus overcome might!  
Well, of sufferance comes ease.

**DOLL TEARSHEET**  
Come, you rogue, come; bring me to a justice.

**MISTRESS QUICKLY**  
Ay, come, you starved blood-hound.

**DOLL TEARSHEET**  
Goodman death, goodman bones!

**MISTRESS QUICKLY**  
Thou atomy, thou!

**DOLL TEARSHEET**  
Come, you thin thing; come you rascal.

**Officer**  
Very well.

*Exeunt*

### SCENE V. A public place near Westminster Abbey.

*Enter FALSTAFF, SHALLOW, PISTOL, and BARDOLPH*

**FALSTAFF**  
Stand here by me, Master Robert Shallow; I will  
make the king do you grace: I will leer upon him as  
a' comes by; and do but mark the countenance that he  
will give me.

**PISTOL**  
God bless thy lungs, good knight.

**FALSTAFF**  
Come here, Pistol; stand behind me. O, if I had had  
time to have made new liveries, I would have  
bestowed the thousand pound I borrowed of you. But  
'tis no matter; this poor show doth better: this  
doth infer the zeal I had to see him.

**SHALLOW**  
It doth so.

**FALSTAFF**  
It shows my earnestness of affection,--

**SHALLOW**  
It doth so.

**FALSTAFF**  
My devotion,--

**SHALLOW**  
It doth, it doth, it doth.

**FALSTAFF**  
As it were, to ride day and night; and not to  
deliberate, not to remember, not to have patience  
to shift me,--

**SHALLOW**  
It is best, certain.

**FALSTAFF**  
But to stand stained with travel, and sweating with  
desire to see him; thinking of nothing else,  
putting all affairs else in oblivion, as if there  
were nothing else to be done but to see him.

**PISTOL**  
'Tis 'semper idem,' for 'obsque hoc nihil est:'  
'tis all in every part.

**SHALLOW**  
'Tis so, indeed.

**PISTOL**  
My knight, I will inflame thy noble liver,  
And make thee rage.  
Thy Doll, and Helen of thy noble thoughts,  
Is in base durance and contagious prison;  
Haled thither  
By most mechanical and dirty hand:  
Rouse up revenge from ebon den with fell  
Alecto's snake,  
For Doll is in. Pistol speaks nought but truth.

**FALSTAFF**  
I will deliver her.

*Shouts within, and the trumpets sound*

**PISTOL**  
There roar'd the sea, and trumpet-clangor sounds.

*Enter KING HENRY V and the Lord Chief-Justice*

**FALSTAFF**  
God save thy grace, King Hal! my royal Hal!

**PISTOL**  
The heavens thee guard and keep, most royal imp of fame!

**FALSTAFF**  
God save thee, my sweet boy!

**KING HENRY IV**  
My lord chief-justice, speak to that vain man.

**Lord Chief-Justice**  
Have you your wits? know you what 'tis to speak?

**FALSTAFF**  
My king! my Jove! I speak to thee, my heart!

**KING HENRY IV**  
I know thee not, old man: fall to thy prayers;  
How ill white hairs become a fool and jester!  
I have long dream'd of such a kind of man,  
So surfeit-swell'd, so old and so profane;  
But, being awaked, I do despise my dream.  
Make less thy body hence, and more thy grace;  
Leave gormandizing; know the grave doth gape  
For thee thrice wider than for other men.  
Reply not to me with a fool-born jest:  
Presume not that I am the thing I was;  
For God doth know, so shall the world perceive,  
That I have turn'd away my former self;  
So will I those that kept me company.  
When thou dost hear I am as I have been,  
Approach me, and thou shalt be as thou wast,  
The tutor and the feeder of my riots:  
Till then, I banish thee, on pain of death,  
As I have done the rest of my misleaders,  
Not to come near our person by ten mile.  
For competence of life I will allow you,  
That lack of means enforce you not to evil:  
And, as we hear you do reform yourselves,  
We will, according to your strengths and qualities,  
Give you advancement. Be it your charge, my lord,  
To see perform'd the tenor of our word. Set on.

*Exeunt KING HENRY V, & Lord Chief Justice*

**FALSTAFF**  
Master Shallow, I owe you a thousand pound.

**SHALLOW**  
Yea, marry, Sir John; which I beseech you to let me  
have home with me.

**FALSTAFF**  
That can hardly be, Master Shallow. Do not you  
grieve at this; I shall be sent for in private to  
him: look you, he must seem thus to the world:  
fear not your advancements; I will be the man yet  
that shall make you great.

**SHALLOW**  
I cannot well perceive how, unless you should give  
me your doublet and stuff me out with straw. I  
beseech you, good Sir John, let me have five hundred  
of my thousand.

**FALSTAFF**  
Sir, I will be as good as my word: this that you  
heard was but a colour.

**SHALLOW**  
A colour that I fear you will die in, Sir John.

**FALSTAFF**  
Fear no colours: go with me to dinner: come,  
Lieutenant Pistol; come, Bardolph: I shall be sent  
for soon at night.

*Re-enter Prince John of LANCASTER, the Lord Chief-Justice; an Officer
with them*

**Lord Chief-Justice**  
Go, carry Sir John Falstaff to the Fleet:  
Take all his company along with him.

**FALSTAFF**  
My lord, my lord,--

**Lord Chief-Justice**  
I cannot now speak: I will hear you soon.  
Take them away.

**PISTOL**  
Si fortune me tormenta, spero contenta.

*Exeunt all but PRINCE JOHN and the Lord Chief-Justice*

**LANCASTER**  
I like this fair proceeding of the king's:  
He hath intent his wonted followers  
Shall all be very well provided for;  
But all are banish'd till their conversations  
Appear more wise and modest to the world.

**Lord Chief-Justice**  
And so they are.

**LANCASTER**  
The king hath call'd his parliament, my lord.

**Lord Chief-Justice**  
He hath.

**LANCASTER**  
I will lay odds that, ere this year expire,  
We bear our civil swords and native fire  
As far as France: I beard a bird so sing,  
Whose music, to my thinking, pleased the king.  
Come, will you hence?

*Exeunt*

# Two Noble Kinsmen, Uncut

## ACT I

### SCENE I: Athens. Before a Temple.

*Enter with a torch burning; Theseus in wedding pomp; then Hippolyta, the bride, led by
Pirithous; after her, Emilia, holding up her train.*

*Enter three Queens, in black, with veils stain'd, with imperial crowns.*

*The first Queen falls down at the foot of Theseus; the second falls down at the foot of
Hippolyta; the third before Emilia.*

**FIRST QUEEN**  
For pity's sake and true gentility's,  
Hear and respect me. /

**SECOND QUEEN**  
/ For your mother's sake,  
And as you wish your womb may thrive with fair ones,  
Hear and respect me.

**THIRD QUEEN**  
Now for the love of him whom Jove hath mark'd  
The honor of your bed, and for the sake  
Of clear virginity, be advocate  
For us and our distresses! This good deed  
Shall raze you out o' th' book of trespasses  
All you are set down there.

**THESEUS**  
Sad lady, rise. /

**HIPPOLYTA**  
/ Stand up. /

**EMILIA**  
/ No knees to me.  
What woman I may stead that is distress'd  
Does bind me to her.

**THESEUS**  
What's your request? Deliver you for all.

**FIRST QUEEN**  
We are three queens, whose sovereigns fell before  
The wrath of cruel Creon; who endured  
The beaks of ravens, talents of the kites,  
And pecks of crows in the foul fields of Thebes.  
He will not suffer us to burn their bones,  
To urn their ashes, nor to take th' offense  
Of mortal loathsomeness from the blest eye  
Of holy Phoebus, but infects the winds  
With stench of our slain lords. O, pity, Duke,  
Thou purger of the earth, draw thy fear'd sword  
That does good turns to th' world; give us the bones  
Of our dead kings, that we may chapel them;  
And of thy boundless goodness take some note  
That for our crowned heads we have no roof,  
Save this which is the lion's, and the bear's,  
And vault to everything! /

**THESEUS**  
/ Pray you kneel not;  
I was transported with your speech, and suffer'd  
Your knees to wrong themselves. I have heard the fortunes  
Of your dead lords, which gives me such lamenting  
As wakes my vengeance and revenge for 'em.

**FIRST QUEEN**  
O, I hope some god,  
Some god hath put his mercy in your manhood,  
Whereto he'll infuse pow'r, and press you forth  
Our undertaker. /

**THESEUS**  
/ O, no knees, none, widow!  
Unto the helmeted Bellona use them,  
And pray for me your soldier.  
Troubled I am. /  
*\[Turns away.]*

**SECOND QUEEN**  
/ Honored Hippolyta,  
That equally canst poise sternness with pity,  
Whom now I know hast much more power on him  
Than ever he had on thee, who ow'st his strength,  
And his love too, who is a servant for  
The tenor of thy speech; dear glass of ladies,  
Bid him that we, whom flaming war doth scorch,  
Require him he advance it o'er our heads;  
Speak't in a woman's key--like such a woman  
As any of us three; weep ere you fail;  
Lend us a knee;  
Tell him, if he i' th' blood-siz'd field lay swoll'n,  
Showing the sun his teeth, grinning at the moon,  
What you would do. /

**HIPPOLYTA**  
/ Poor lady, say no more:  
I had as lief trace this good action with you  
As that whereto I am going, and never yet  
Went I so willing way. My lord is taken  
Heart-deep with your distress. Let him consider.  
I'll speak anon. /

**THIRD QUEEN**  
/ O, my petition was

*Kneel to Emilia.*

Set down in ice, which by hot grief uncandied  
Melts into drops; so sorrow wanting form  
Is press'd with deeper matter. /

**EMILIA**  
/ Pray stand up,  
Your grief is written in your cheek. /

**THIRD QUEEN**  
/ O, woe,  
You cannot read it there. There, through my tears,  
Like wrinkled pebbles in a glassy stream,  
You may behold 'em. Lady, lady, alack!  
He that will all the treasure know o' th' earth  
Must know the centre too; he that will fish  
For my least minnow, let him lead his line  
To catch one at my heart. O, pardon me,  
Extremity, that sharpens sundry wits,  
Makes me a fool. /

**EMILIA**  
/ Pray you say nothing, pray you.  
Being a natural sister of our sex,  
Your sorrow beats so ardently upon me  
That it shall make a counter-reflect 'gainst  
My brother's heart, and warm it to some pity,  
Though it were made of stone. Pray have good comfort.

**THESEUS**  
Forward to th' temple. Leave not out a jot  
O' th' sacred ceremony. /

**FIRST QUEEN**  
/ O, this celebration  
Will long last and be more costly than  
Your suppliants' war! Remember that your fame  
Knolls in the ear o' th' world; what you do quickly  
Is not done rashly; your first thought is more  
Than others' labored meditance; your premeditating  
More than their actions. But, O Jove, your actions,  
Soon as they move, as asprays do the fish,  
Subdue before they touch. Think, dear Duke, think  
What beds our slain kings have! /

**SECOND QUEEN**  
/ What griefs our beds  
That our dear lords have none! /

**THIRD QUEEN**  
/ None fit for th' dead:  
Those that with cords, knives, drams, precipitance,  
Weary of this world's light, have to themselves  
Been death's most horrid agents, humane grace  
Affords them dust and shadow. /

**FIRST QUEEN**  
/ But our lords  
Lie blist'ring 'fore the visitating sun,  
And were good kings when living.

**THESEUS**  
It is true; and I will give you comfort  
To give your dead lords graves; the which to do  
Must make some work with Creon.

**FIRST QUEEN**  
And that work presents itself to th' doing:  
Now 'twill take form, the heats are gone tomorrow.  
Then, bootless toil must recompense itself  
With its own sweat; now he's secure,  
Not dreams we stand before your puissance  
Wrinching our holy begging in our eyes  
To make petition clear. /

**SECOND QUEEN**  
/ Now you may take him  
Drunk with his victory. /

**THIRD QUEEN**  
/ And his army full  
Of bread and sloth. /

**THESEUS**  
/ My generals, that best know'st  
How to draw out, fit to this enterprise,  
The prim'st for this proceeding, and the number  
To carry such a business, shall go levy  
Our worthiest instruments, whilst we dispatch  
This grand act of our life, this daring deed  
Of fate in wedlock. /

**FIRST QUEEN**  
/ Dowagers, take hands,  
Let us be widows to our woes; delay  
Commends us to a famishing hope. /

**ALL QUEENS**  
/ Farewell

**SECOND QUEEN**  
We come unseasonably; but when could grief  
Cull forth, as unpang'd judgment can, fitt'st time  
For best solicitation? /

**THESEUS**  
/ Why, good ladies,  
This is a service, whereto I am going,  
Greater than any war; it more imports me  
Than all the actions that I have foregone,  
Or futurely can cope. /

**FIRST QUEEN**  
/ The more proclaiming  
Our suit shall be neglected. When her arms,  
Able to lock Jove from a synod, shall  
By warranting moonlight corslet thee--O, when  
Her twinning cherries shall their sweetness fall  
Upon thy tasteful lips, what wilt thou think  
Of rotten kings or blubber'd queens? What care  
For what thou feel'st not? What thou feel'st being able  
To make Mars spurn his drum. O, if thou couch  
But one night with her, every hour in't will  
Take hostage of thee for a hundred, and  
Thou shalt remember nothing more than what  
That banquet bids thee to! /

**HIPPOLYTA**  
/ Though much unlike  
You should be so transported, as much sorry  
I should be such a suitor; therefore, sir,

*\[Kneels.]*  
As I shall here make trial of my pray'rs,  
Either presuming them to have some force,  
Or sentencing for aye their vigor dumb,  
Prorogue this business we are going about, and hang  
Your shield afore your heart, about that neck  
Which is my fee, and which I freely lend  
To do these poor queens service. /

**THIRD QUEEN**  
*\[To Emilia]*  
/ O, help now!  
Our cause cries for your knee. /

**EMILIA**  
*\[Kneels]*  
/ If you grant not  
My sister her petition, in that force,  
With that celerity and nature, which  
She makes it in, from henceforth I'll not dare  
To ask you anything, nor be so hardy  
Ever to take a husband. /

**THESEUS**  
/ Pray stand up.

*They rise.*

I am entreating of myself to do  
That which you kneel to have me. Pirithous,  
Lead on the bride; get you and pray the gods  
For success and return; omit not any thing  
In the pretended celebration. Queens,  
Follow your soldier. As before, hence we,  
And at the banks of Aulis meet we with  
The forces we can raise, where we shall find  
The moi'ty of a number for a business  
More bigger-look'd. /

*\[To Hippolyta]*  
/ Since that our theme is haste,  
I stamp this kiss upon thy currant lip.  
Sweet, keep it as my token. Set you forward,  
For I will see you gone.

*Exeunt slowly towards the temple.*

Farewell, my beauteous sister. Pirithous,  
Keep the feast full, bate not an hour on't. /

**PIRITHOUS**  
/ Sir,  
I'll follow you at heels; the feast's solemnity  
Shall want till your return. /

**THESEUS**  
/ Cousin, I charge you  
Budge not from Athens. We shall be returning  
Ere you can end this feast, of which I pray you  
Make no abatement. Once more, farewell all.

**FIRST QUEEN**  
Thus dost thou still make good  
The tongue o' th' world. /

**SECOND QUEEN**  
/ And earn'st a deity  
Equal with Mars. /

**THIRD QUEEN**  
/ If not above him, for  
Thou being but mortal makest affections bend  
To godlike honors; they themselves, some say,  
Groan under such a mast'ry. /

**THESEUS**  
/ As we are men  
Thus should we do, being sensually subdu'd  
We lose our human title. Good cheer, ladies.  
Now turn we towards your comforts.

*Flourish. Exeunt.*

### SCENE II: Thebes. The Palace.

*Enter PALAMON and ARCITE.*

**ARCITE**  
Dear Palamon, let us leave the city  
Thebes, and the temptings in't, before we further  
Sully our gloss of youth. /

**PALAMON**  
/ Your advice  
Is cried up with example. What strange ruins,  
Since first we went to school, may we perceive  
Walking in Thebes! Scars and bare weeds  
The gain o' th' martialist, who did propound  
To his bold ends honor and golden ingots,  
Which though he won, he had not; and now flurted  
By peace, for whom he fought, who then shall offer  
To Mars's so scorn'd altar? I do bleed  
When such I meet, and wish great Juno would  
Resume her ancient fit of jealousy  
To get the soldier work, that peace might purge  
For her repletion, and retain anew  
Her charitable heart, now hard, and harsher  
Than strife or war could be. /

**ARCITE**  
/ Are you not out?  
Meet you no ruin but the soldier in  
The cranks and turns of Thebes? You did begin  
As if you met decays of many kinds.  
Perceive you none that do arouse your pity  
But th' unconsider'd soldier? /

**PALAMON**  
/ Yes, I pity  
Decays where e'er I find them, but such most  
That sweating in an honorable toil  
Are paid with ice to cool 'em. /

**ARCITE**  
/ 'Tis not this  
I did begin to speak of. This is virtue  
Of no respect in Thebes. I spake of Thebes,  
How dangerous, if we will keep our honors,  
It is for our residing; where every evil  
Hath a good color; where ev'ry seeming good's  
A certain evil; where not to be ev'n jump  
As they are, here were to be strangers, and  
Such things to be, mere monsters. /

**PALAMON**  
/ 'Tis in our power  
(Unless we fear that apes can tutor's) to  
Be masters of our manners. Am I bound  
By any generous bond to follow him  
Follows his tailor, haply so long until  
The follow'd make pursuit? Either I am  
The forehorse in the team, or I am none  
That draw i' th' sequent trace. These poor slight sores  
Need not a plantin; that which rips my bosom  
Almost to th' heart's-- /

**ARCITE**  
/ Our uncle Creon. /

**PALAMON**  
/ He,  
A most unbounded tyrant, whose successes  
Makes heaven unfear'd, and villainy assured  
Beyond its power there's nothing; almost puts  
Faith in a fever, and deifies alone  
Voluble chance; who only attributes  
The faculties of other instruments  
To his own nerves and act; commands men service,  
And what they win in't, boot and glory; one  
That fears not to do harm; good, dares not. Let  
The blood of mine that's sib to him be suck'd  
From me with leeches! Let them break and fall  
Off me with that corruption! /

**ARCITE**  
/ Clear-spirited cousin,  
Let's leave his court, that we may nothing share  
Of his loud infamy; for our milk  
Will relish of the pasture, and we must  
Be vile, or disobedient--not his kinsmen  
In blood unless in quality. /

**PALAMON**  
/ Nothing truer.  
I think the echoes of his shames have deaf'd  
The ears of heav'nly justice. Widows' cries  
Descend again into their throats, and have not  
Due audience of the gods. /

*Enter Valerius.*

/ Valerius!

**VALERIUS**  
The King calls for you; yet be leaden-footed  
Till his great rage be off him. /

**PALAMON**  
/ The matter?

**VALERIUS**  
Theseus (who where he threats appalls) hath sent  
Deadly defiance to him, and pronounces  
Ruin to Thebes; who is at hand to seal  
The promise of his wrath. /

**ARCITE**  
/ Let him approach.
Is't said this war's afoot? Or it shall be,  
On fail of some condition? /

**VALERIUS**  
/ 'Tis in motion,  
The intelligence of state came in the instant  
With the defier. /

**PALAMON**  
/ Let's to the King, who were he  
A quarter carrier of that honor which  
His enemy come in, the blood we venture  
Should be as for our health, which were not spent,  
Rather laid out for purchase. But alas,  
Our hands advanc'd before our hearts, what will  
The fall o' th' stroke do damage? /

**ARCITE**  
/ Let th' event,  
That never-erring arbitrator, tell us  
When we know all ourselves, and let us follow  
The becking of our chance.

*Exeunt.*

### SCENE III: Before the Gates of Athens

*Enter Pirithous, Hippolyta, Emilia.*

**PIRITHOUS**
No further. /

**HIPPOLYTA**  
/ Sir, farewell. Repeat my wishes  
To our great lord, of whose success I dare not  
Make any timorous question; yet I wish him  
Excess and overflow of power, and't might be,  
To dure ill-dealing fortune. Speed to him,  
Store never hurts good governors. /

**PIRITHOUS**  
/ Though I know  
His ocean needs not my poor drops, yet they  
Must yield their tribute there. My precious maid,  
Those best affections that the heavens infuse  
In their best-temper'd pieces, keep enthron'd  
In your dear heart! /

**EMILIA**  
/ Thanks, sir. Remember me  
To our all-royal brother. /

**PIRITHOUS**  
/ Peace be to you  
As I pursue this war, which shall be then  
Beyond further requiring. /

*Exit Pirithous.*

**EMILIA**  
/ How his longing  
Follows his friend. Have you observ'd him  
Since our great lord departed? /

**HIPPOLYTA**  
/ With much labor;  
And I did love him for't. Their knot of love  
Tied, weav'd, entangled, with so true, so long,  
And with a finger of so deep a cunning,  
May be outworn, never undone. I think  
Theseus cannot be umpire to himself,  
Cleaving his conscience into twain and doing  
Each side like justice, which he loves best. /

**EMILIA**  
/ Doubtless  
There is a best, and reason has no manners  
To say it is not you. I was acquainted  
Once with a time when I enjoy'd a playfellow;  
You were at wars when she the grave enrich'd,  
Who made too proud the bed, took leave o' th' moon  
(Which then look'd pale at parting) when our count  
Was each eleven. /

**HIPPOLYTA**  
/ 'Twas Flavina. /

**EMILIA**  
/ Yes.  
You talk of Pirithous' and Theseus' love:  
Theirs has more ground, is more maturely season'd,  
More buckled with strong judgment, and their needs  
The one of th' other may be said to water  
Their intertangled roots of love, but I  
And she (I sigh and spoke of) were things innocent,  
Lov'd for we did, and like the elements  
That know not what nor why, yet do effect  
Rare issues by their operance, our souls  
Did so to one another. What she lik'd  
Was then of me approv'd, what not, condemn'd,  
No more arraignment. On my head no toy  
But was her pattern, her affections (pretty,  
Though happily her careless wear) I followed  
For my most serious decking. Had mine ear  
Stol'n some new air, or at adventure humm'd one  
From musical coinage, why, it was a note  
Whereon her spirits would sojourn (rather dwell on)  
And sing it in her slumbers. This rehearsal  
(Which, ev'ry innocent wots well, comes in  
Like old importment's bastard) has this end,  
That the true love 'tween maid and maid may be  
More than in sex dividual. /

**HIPPOLYTA**  
/ Y' are out of breath,  
And this high-speeded pace is but to say  
That you shall never (like the maid Flavina)  
Love any that's call'd man. /

**EMILIA**  
/ I am sure I shall not.

**HIPPOLYTA**  
Now alack, weak sister,  
I must no more believe thee in this point  
(Though in't I know thou dost believe thyself)  
Than I will trust a sickly appetite,  
That loathes even as it longs. But sure, my sister,  
If I were ripe for your persuasion, you  
Have said enough to shake me from the arm  
Of the all-noble Theseus, for whose fortunes  
I will now in and kneel, with great assurance  
That we, more than his Pirithous, possess  
The high throne in his heart. /

**EMILIA**  
/ I am not  
Against your faith, yet I continue mine.

*Exeunt.*

### SCENE IV: A Field Before Thebes

*Cornets. A battle struck within; then a retreat; flourish. Then enter Theseus, victor. The three Queens meet him and fall on their faces before him.*

**FIRST QUEEN**  
To thee no star be dark. /

**SECOND QUEEN**  
/ Both heaven and earth  
Friend thee forever. /

**THIRD QUEEN**  
/ All the good that may  
Be wish'd upon thy head, I cry amen to't.

**THESEUS**  
Th' impartial gods, who from the mounted heavens  
View us their mortal herd, behold who err,  
And in their time chastise. Go and find out  
The bones of your dead lords, and honor them  
With treble ceremony; rather than a gap  
Should be in their dear rites, we would supply't. /

*Exeunt Queens.*

*Enter Herald bearing Palamon and Arcite on two hearses.*

/ What are those?

**HERALD**  
Men of great quality, as may be judg'd  
By their appointment. Some of Thebes have told's  
They are sisters' children, nephews to the King.

**THESEUS**  
By th' helm of Mars, I saw them in the war,  
Like to a pair of lions smear'd with prey,  
Make lanes in troops aghast. I fix'd my note  
Constantly on them; for they were a mark  
Worth a god's view. What was't that prisoner told me  
When I inquired their names? /

**HERALD**  
/ Wi' leave, they're called  
Arcite and Palamon. /

**THESEUS**  
/ 'Tis right--those, those.  
They are not dead?

**HERALD**  
Nor in a state of life; had they been taken  
When their last hurts were given, 'twas possible  
They might have been recovered. Yet they breathe  
And have the name of men. /

**THESEUS**  
/ Then like men use 'em.  
The very lees of such (millions of rates)  
Exceed the wine of others. All our surgeons  
Convent in their behoof, our richest balms,  
Rather than niggard, waste; their lives concern us  
Much more than Thebes is worth. Rather than have 'em  
Freed of this plight, and in their morning state  
(Sound and at liberty), I would 'em dead;  
But forty thousand fold we had rather have 'em  
Prisoners to us than death.

*Flourish. Exeunt, Attendants bearing Palamon and Arcite.*

## ACT II

### SCENE I: Athens. A Garden, With a Prison in the Background.

*Enter Jailer and Wooer.*

**JAILER**  
Alas, the prison I keep, though it be for great ones, yet they
seldom come. I am given out to be better lin'd than it can
appear to me report is a true speaker. I would I were really
that I am deliver'd to be. Marry, what I have (be it what it will)
I will assure upon my daughter at the day of my death.

**WOOER**  
Sir, I demand no more than your own offer, and I will estate
your daughter in what I have promis'd.

**JAILER**  
But have you a full promise of her? When that shall be seen,
I tender my consent.

*Enter Daughter with strewings.*

**WOOER**  
I have, sir. Here she comes.

**JAILER**  
Your friend and I have chanc'd to name you here, upon the
old business. But no more of that now; so soon as the court
hurry is over, we will have an end of it. I' th' mean time, look
tenderly to the two prisoners. I can tell you they are princes.

**DAUGHTER**  
These strewings are for their chamber. 'Tis pity they are in
prison, and 'twere pity they should be out. I do think they
have patience to make any adversity asham'd. The prison
itself is proud of 'em; and they have all the world in their
chamber.

**JAILER**  
They are fam'd to be a pair of absolute men.

**DAUGHTER**  
By my troth, I think fame but stammers 'em, they stand a grise
above the reach of report.

**JAILER**  
I heard them reported in the battle to be the only doers.

**DAUGHTER**  
Nay, most likely, for they are noble suff'rers. I marvel how they
would have look'd had they been victors, that with such a constant
nobility enforce a freedom out of bondage, making misery their
mirth, and affliction a toy to jest at.

**JAILER**  
Do they so?

**DAUGHTER**  
It seems to me they have no more sense of their captivity than I of
ruling Athens. They eat well, look merrily, discourse of many things,
but nothing of their own restraint and disasters.

**WOOER**  
I never saw 'em.

**JAILER**  
The Duke himself came privately in the night, and so did they. What
the reason of it is, I know not.

*Enter Palamon and Arcite above.*

Look yonder they are! That's Arcite looks out.

**DAUGHTER**  
No, sir, no, that's Palamon. Arcite is the lower of the twain; you may
perceive a part of him.

**JAILER**  
Go to, leave your pointing. They would not make us their object.
Out of their sight.

**DAUGHTER**  
It is a holiday to look on them. Lord, the diff'rence of men!

*Exeunt Jailer, Wooer, and Daughter.*

### SCENE II: The Prison.

*Enter Palamon, and Arcite in prison.*

**PALAMON**  
Where is Thebes now? Where is our noble country?  
Where are our friends and kindreds? Never more  
Must we behold those comforts, never see  
The hardy youths strive for the games of honor,  
Hung with the painted favors of their ladies,  
Like tall ships under sail; then start amongst 'em  
And as an east wind leave 'em all behind us,  
Like lazy clouds, whilst Palamon and Arcite,  
Outstripp'd the people's praises, won the garlands,  
Ere they have time to wish 'em ours. O, never  
Shall we two exercise, like twins of honor,  
Our arms again, and feel our fiery horses  
Like proud seas under us. /

**ARCITE**  
/ No, Palamon,  
Those hopes are prisoners with us. Here we are,  
And here the graces of our youths must wither  
Like a too-timely spring. Here age must find us,  
And which is heaviest, Palamon, unmarried.  
The sweet embraces of a loving wife,  
Shall never clasp our necks; no issue know us;  
We shall know nothing here but one another,  
Hear nothing but the clock that tells our woes;  
Summer shall come, and with her all delights,  
But dead-cold winter must inhabit here still.

**ARCITE**  
Shall we make worthy uses of this place  
That all men hate so much? /

**PALAMON**  
/ How, gentle cousin?

**ARCITE**  
Let's think this prison holy sanctuary  
To keep us from corruption of worse men.  
We are young and yet desire the ways of honor,  
That liberty and common conversation,  
The poison of pure spirits, might, like women,  
Woo us to wander from. What worthy blessing  
Can be, but our imaginations  
May make it ours? And here being thus together,  
We are an endless mine to one another;  
We are one another's wife, ever begetting  
New births of love; we are father, friends, acquaintance;  
We are, in one another, families:  
I am your heir, and you are mine; this place  
Is our inheritance. No hard oppressor  
Dare take this from us; here with a little patience  
We shall live long, and loving. /

**PALAMON**  
/ You have made me  
(I thank you, cousin Arcite) almost wanton  
With my captivity. What a misery  
It is to live abroad, and everywhere!  
'Tis like a beast, methinks. I find the court here,  
I am sure, a more content, and all those pleasures  
That woo the wills of men to vanity  
I see through now, and am sufficient  
To tell the world 'tis but a gaudy shadow  
That old Time, as he passes by, takes with him.  
Is there record of any two that lov'd  
Better than we do, Arcite? /

**ARCITE**  
/ Sure there cannot.

**PALAMON**  
I do not think it possible our friendship  
Should ever leave us. /

**ARCITE**  
/ Till our deaths it cannot,

*Enter Emilia and her Woman below.*

And after death our spirits shall be led  
To those that love eternally. Speak on, sir.

**EMILIA**  
This garden has a world of pleasures in't.  
What flow'r is this? /

**WOMAN**  
/ 'Tis call'd narcissus, madam.

**EMILIA**  
That was a fair boy certain, but a fool  
To love himself. Were there not maids enough?

**ARCITE**  
Pray forward. /

**PALAMON**  
/ Yes. /

**EMILIA**  
/ Or were they all hard-hearted?

**WOMAN**  
They could not be to one so fair. /

**EMILIA**  
/ Thou wouldst not.

**WOMAN**  
I think I should not, madam. /

**EMILIA**  
/ That's a good wench!  
But take heed to your kindness though. /

**WOMAN**  
/ Why, madam?

**EMILIA**  
Men are mad things. /

**ARCITE**  
/ Will ye go forward, cousin?

**EMILIA**  
Canst not thou work such flowers in silk, wench? /

**WOMAN**  
/ Yes.

**EMILIA**  
I'll have a gown full of 'em, and of these:  
This is a pretty color, will't not do  
Rarely upon a skirt, wench? /

**WOMAN**  
/ Dainty, madam.

**ARCITE**  
Cousin, cousin, how do you, sir? Why, Palamon!

**PALAMON**  
Never till now I was in prison, Arcite.

**ARCITE**  
Why, what's the matter, man? /

**PALAMON**  
/ Behold, and wonder!  
By heaven, she's a goddess. /

**EMILIA**  
/ Of all flow'rs  
Methinks a rose is best. /

**WOMAN**  
/ Why, gentle madam?

**EMILIA**  
It is the very emblem of a maid;  
For when the west wind courts her gently,  
How modestly she blows, and paints the sun  
With her chaste blushes! When the north comes near her,  
Rude and impatient, then, like chastity,  
She locks her beauties in her bud again,  
And leaves him to base briers. /

**WOMAN**  
/ Yet, good madam,  
Sometimes her modesty will blow so far she falls for't.  
A maid, if she have any honor, would be loath  
To take example by her. /

**EMILIA**  
/ Thou art wanton.

**ARCITE**  
She is wondrous fair. /

**PALAMON**  
/ She is all the beauty extant.

**EMILIA**  
The sun grows high, let's walk in. Keep these flowers,  
We'll see how near art can come near their colors.  
I am wondrous merry-hearted, I could laugh now.

**WOMAN.**  
I could lie down, I am sure. /

**EMILIA**  
/ And take one with you?

**WOMAN**  
That's as we bargain, madam. /

**EMILIA**  
/ Well, agree then.

*Exeunt Emilia and Woman.*

**PALAMON**  
What think you of this beauty? /

**ARCITE**  
/ 'Tis a rare one.

**PALAMON**  
Is't but a rare one? /

**ARCITE**  
/ Yes, a matchless beauty.

**PALAMON**  
Might not a man well lose himself and love her?

**ARCITE**  
I cannot tell what you have done; I have,  
Beshrew mine eyes for't! Now I feel my shackles.

**PALAMON**  
You love her then? /

**ARCITE**  
/ Who would not? /

**PALAMON**  
/ And desire her?

**ARCITE**  
Before my liberty.

**PALAMON**  
I saw her first. /

**ARCITE**  
/ That's nothing. /

**PALAMON**  
/ But it shall be.

**ARCITE**  
I saw her too. /

**PALAMON**  
/ Yes, but you must not love her.

**ARCITE**  
I will not, as you do--to worship her  
As she is heavenly and a blessed goddess;  
I love her as a woman, to enjoy her.  
So both may love. /

**PALAMON**  
/ You shall not love at all.

**ARCITE**  
Not love at all! Who shall deny me?

**PALAMON**  
I, that first saw her; I, that took possession  
First with mine eye of all those beauties in her  
Reveal'd to mankind. If thou lov'st her,  
Or entertain'st a hope to blast my wishes,  
Thou art a traitor, Arcite, and a fellow  
False as thy title to her. Friendship, blood,  
And all the ties between us, I disclaim  
If thou once think upon her. /

**ARCITE**  
/ Yes, I love her,  
And if the lives of all my name lay on it,  
I must do so; I love her with my soul;  
If that will lose ye, farewell, Palamon.  
I say again, I love, and in loving her maintain  
I am as worthy and as free a lover,  
And have as just a title to her beauty,  
As any Palamon or any living  
That is a man's son. /

**PALAMON**  
/ Have I call'd thee friend?

**ARCITE**  
Yes, and have found me so. Why are you mov'd thus?  
Let me deal coldly with you: am not I  
Part of your blood, part of your soul? You have told me  
That I was Palamon, and you were Arcite.

**PALAMON**
/ Yes.

**ARCITE**
/ Why then would you deal so cunningly,  
So strangely, so unlike a noble kinsman,  
To love alone? Speak truly: do you think me  
Unworthy of her sight? /

**PALAMON**  
/ No; but unjust  
If thou pursue that sight. /

**ARCITE**  
/ Because another  
First sees the enemy, shall I stand still,  
And let mine honor down, and never charge?

**PALAMON**  
Yes, if he be but one. /

**ARCITE**  
/ But say that one  
Had rather combat me? /

**PALAMON**  
/ Let that one say so,  
And use thy freedom; else, if thou pursuest her,  
Be as that cursed man that hates his country,  
A branded villain. /

**ARCITE**  
/ You are mad. /

**PALAMON**  
/ I must be--  
Till thou art worthy, Arcite, it concerns me,  
And in this madness if I hazard thee  
And take thy life, I deal but truly. /

**ARCITE**  
/ Fie, sir!  
You play the child extremely. I will love her,  
I must, I ought to do so, and I dare--  
And all this justly. /

**PALAMON**  
/ O that now, that now  
Thy false-self and thy friend had but this fortune  
To be one hour at liberty, and grasp  
Our good swords in our hands, I would quickly teach thee  
What 'twere to filch affection from another!  
Thou art baser in it than a cutpurse.  
Put but thy head out of this window more,  
And as I have a soul, I'll nail thy life to't!

**ARCITE**  
Thou dar'st not, fool, thou canst not, thou art feeble.  
Put my head out? I'll throw my body out,  
And leap the garden, when I see her next,  
And pitch between her arms to anger thee.

*Enter Jailer above.*

**PALAMON**  
No more; the keeper's coming. I shall live  
To knock thy brains out with my shackles. /

**ARCITE**  
/ Do.

**JAILER**  
Lord Arcite, you must presently to th' Duke;  
The cause I know not yet. /

**ARCITE**  
/ I am ready, keeper.

**JAILER**  
Prince Palamon, I must awhile bereave you  
Of your fair cousin's company. /

*Exeunt Arcite and Jailer.*

**PALAMON**  
/ And me too,  
Even when you please, of life. Why is he sent for?  
It may be he shall marry her; he's goodly,  
And like enough the Duke hath taken notice  
Both of his blood and body. But his falsehood!  
Why should a friend be treacherous? If that  
Get him a wife so noble and so fair,  
Let honest men ne'er love again. Once more  
I would but see this fair one. Blessed garden,  
And fruit and flowers more blessed, that still blossom  
As her bright eyes shine on ye, would I were,  
For all the fortune of my life hereafter,  
Yon little tree, yon blooming apricot!  
How I would spread, and fling my wanton arms  
In at her window! I would bring her fruit  
Fit for the gods to feed on; youth and pleasure,  
Still as she tasted, should be doubled on her,  
And if she be not heavenly, I would make her  
So near the gods in nature, they should fear her;  
And then I am sure she would love me.

*Enter Jailer above.*

Where's Arcite? /

**JAILER**  
/ Banish'd. Prince Pirithous  
Obtained his liberty; but never more,  
Upon his oath and life, must he set foot  
Upon this kingdom. /

**PALAMON**  
/ He's a blessed man!  
He shall see Thebes again, and call to arms  
The bold young men that when he bids 'em charge,  
Fall on like fire. Arcite shall have a fortune,  
If he dare make himself a worthy lover,  
Yet in the field to strike a battle for her;  
And if he lose her then, he's a cold coward.  
Were I at liberty, I would do things  
Of such a virtuous greatness that this lady,  
This blushing virgin, should take manhood to her  
And seek to ravish me. /

**JAILER**  
/ My lord, for you  
I have this charge too-- /

**PALAMON**  
/ To discharge my life?

**JAILER**  
No, but from this place to remove your lordship;  
The windows are too open. /

**PALAMON**  
/ Devils take 'em  
That are so envious to me! Prithee kill me.

**JAILER**  
And hang for't afterward? /

**PALAMON**  
/ I will not go.

**JAILER**  
Indeed you must, my lord. /

**PALAMON**  
/ May I see the garden?

**JAILER**  
No. /

**PALAMON**  
/ Then I am resolv'd, I will not go. /

**JAILER**  
/ I must  
Constrain you then; and for you are dangerous  
I'll clap more irons on you. /

**PALAMON**
/ Must I go?

**JAILER**
There is no remedy. /

**PALAMON**  
*\[Aside]*  
/ Farewell, kind window.  
May rude wind never hurt thee! O my lady,  
If ever thou hast felt what sorrow was,  
Dream how I suffer!--Come; now bury me.

*Exeunt Palamon and Jailer.*

### SCENE III: The Country Near Athens.

*Enter Arcite.*

**ARCITE**  
Banish'd the kingdom? 'Tis a benefit,  
A mercy I must thank 'em for; but banish'd  
The free enjoying of that face I die for--  
O, 'twas a studied punishment, a death  
Beyond imagination! Such a vengeance  
That were I old and wicked, all my sins  
Could never pluck upon me. Palamon!  
Thou hast the start now; thou shalt stay and see  
Her bright eyes break each morning 'gainst thy window,  
And let in life into thee; thou shalt feed  
Upon the sweetness of a noble beauty,  
That nature nev'r exceeded, nor nev'r shall.  
Twenty to one, he'll come to speak to her,  
And if she be as gentle as she's fair,  
I know she's his; he has a tongue will tame tempests,  
And make the wild rocks wanton. Come what can come,  
The worst is death: I will not leave the kingdom.  
I know mine own is but a heap of ruins,  
And no redress there. If I go, he has her.  
I am resolv'd another shape shall make me,  
Or end my fortunes. Either way, I am happy:  
I'll see her, and be near her, or no more.  
*\[Retires.]*

*Enter four Countrymen.*

**FIRST COUNTRYMAN**  
My good friends, I'll be there, that's certain.

**SECOND COUNTRYMAN**  
And I'll be there.

**THIRD COUNTRYMAN**  
And I.

**FOURTH COUNTRYMAN**  
Why then have with ye, friends! 'Tis but a chiding.

**ARCITE**  
*\[Comes forward.]*  
By your leaves, honest friends: pray you, whither go you?

**FOURTH COUNTRYMAN**  
Whither? Why, what a question! /

**THIRD COUNTRYMAN**  
/ To the games, friend.

**SECOND COUNTRYMAN**  
Where were you bred you know it not? /

**ARCITE**  
/ Not far, sir.  
Are there such games today? /

**FIRST COUNTRYMAN**  
/ Yes, marry, are there;  
And such as you never saw. The Duke himself  
Will be in person there. /

**ARCITE**  
/ What pastimes are they?

**SECOND COUNTRYMAN**  
Wrastling and running.--'Tis a pretty fellow.

**THIRD COUNTRYMAN**  
Thou wilt not go along? /

**ARCITE**  
/ Not yet, sir. /

**FOURTH COUNTRYMAN**  
/ Well, sir,  
Take your own time. Come, boys. /

**FIRST COUNTRYMAN**  
/ My mind misgives me  
This fellow has a veng'ance trick o' th' hip,  
Mark how his body's made for't. /

**SECOND COUNTRYMAN**  
/ I'll be hang'd though  
If he dare venture. Hang him, plum porridge!  
He wrestle? He roast eggs! Come let's be gone, lads.

*Exeunt four Countryfolk.*

**ARCITE**  
This is an offer'd opportunity  
I durst not wish for. Well I could have wrestled,  
The best men call'd it excellent; and run  
Swifter than wind upon a field of corn,  
Curling the wealthy ears, never flew. I'll venture,  
And in some poor disguise be there. Who knows  
Whether my brows may not be girt with garlands,  
And happiness prefer me to a place  
Where I may ever dwell in sight of her?

*Exit Arcite.*

### SCENE IV: Athens. A Room in the Prison.

*Enter Jailer's Daughter alone.*

**DAUGHTER**  
Why should I love this gentleman? 'Tis odds  
He never will affect me. I am base,  
My father the mean keeper of his prison,  
And he a prince. To marry him is hopeless;  
To be his whore is witless. Out upon't!  
What pushes are we wenches driven to  
When fifteen once has found us! First, I saw him:  
I, seeing, thought he was a goodly man;  
He has as much to please a woman in him  
(If he please to bestow it so) as ever  
These eyes yet look'd on. Next, I pitied him;  
And so would any young wench o' my conscience  
That ever dream'd, or vow'd her maidenhead  
To a young handsome man. Then, I lov'd him,  
Extremely lov'd him, infinitely lov'd him;  
And yet he had a cousin, fair as he too;  
But in my heart was Palamon, and there,  
Lord, what a coil he keeps! To hear him  
Sing in an evening, what a heaven it is!  
And yet his songs are sad ones. Fairer spoken  
Was never gentleman. When I come in  
To bring him water in a morning, first  
He bows his noble body, then salutes me thus:  
"Fair gentle maid, good morrow. May thy goodness  
Get thee a happy husband!" Once he kiss'd me--  
I lov'd my lips the better ten days after.  
Would he would do so ev'ry day! He grieves much,  
And me as much to see his misery.  
What should I do to make him know I love him,  
For I would fain enjoy him? Say I ventur'd  
To set him free? What says the law then?  
Thus much for law or kindred! I will do it,  
And this night, or tomorrow, he shall love me.

*Exit.*

### SCENE V: Athens. An Open Place.

*This short flourish of cornets, and shouts within. Enter Theseus, Hippolyta, Pirithous, Emilia, Arcite disguised, with a garland.*

**THESEUS**  
You have done worthily. I have not seen,  
Since Hercules, a man of tougher sinews.  
What e'er you are, you run the best, and wrestle,  
That these times can allow. /

**ARCITE**
/ I am proud to please you.

**THESEUS**
What made you seek this place, sir? /

**ARCITE**  
/ Noble Theseus,  
To purchase name, and do my ablest service  
To such a well-found wonder as thy worth,  
For only in thy court, of all the world,  
Dwells fair-ey'd honor. /

**PIRITHOUS**  
/ All his words are worthy.

**THESEUS**  
Sir, we are much indebted to your travel,  
Nor shall you lose your wish. Pirithous,  
Dispose of this fair gentleman. /

**PIRITHOUS**  
/ Thanks, Theseus.--  
What e'er you are, y' are mine, and I shall give you  
To a most noble service--to this lady,  
This bright young virgin. Pray observe her goodness.  
You have honor'd her fair birthday with your virtues,  
And as your due y' are hers. Kiss her fair hand, sir.

**ARCITE**  
Sir, y' are a noble giver. Dearest beauty,  
Thus let me seal my vow'd faith.  
*\[Kisses Emilia's hand.]*

When your servant  
(Your most unworthy creature) but offends you,  
Command him die, he shall. /

**EMILIA**  
/ That were too cruel.  
If you deserve well, sir, I shall soon see't.  
Y' are mine, and somewhat better than your rank I'll use you.

**THESEUS**  
It shall be so; you shall receive all dues  
Fit for the honor you have won; 'twere wrong else.  
Sister, beshrew my heart, you have a servant  
That if I were a woman, would be master,  
But you are wise. /

**EMILIA**  
/ I hope too wise for that, sir.

*Flourish. Exeunt omnes.*

### SCENE VI: Athens. Before the Prison.

*Enter Jailer's Daughter alone.*

**DAUGHTER**  
Let all the dukes and all the devils roar,  
He is at liberty! I have ventur'd for him,  
And out I have brought him to a little wood  
A mile hence. I have sent him where a cedar,  
Higher than all the rest, spreads like a plane  
Fast by a brook, and there he shall keep close  
Till I provide him files and food, for yet  
His iron bracelets are not off. O Love,  
What a stout-hearted child thou art! My father  
Durst better have endur'd cold iron than done it.  
I love him beyond love and beyond reason,  
Or wit, or safety. I have made him know it.  
I care not, I am desperate. If the law  
Find me, and then condemn me for't, some wenches,  
Some honest-hearted maids, will sing my dirge,  
And tell to memory my death was noble,  
Dying almost a martyr. That way he takes  
I purpose is my way too. Sure he cannot  
Be so unmanly as to leave me here.  
If he do, maids will not so easily  
Trust men again. And yet he has not thank'd me  
For what I have done; no, not so much as kiss'd me;  
And that, methinks, is not so well; nor scarcely  
Could I persuade him to become a freeman,  
He made such scruples of the wrong he did  
To me and to my father. Yet I hope,  
When he considers more, this love of mine  
Will take more root within him. Let him do  
What he will with me, so he use me kindly,  
For use me so he shall, or I'll proclaim him,  
And to his face, no man. I'll presently  
Provide him necessaries, and pack my clothes up,  
And where there is a path of ground I'll venture,  
So he be with me. By him, like a shadow,  
I'll ever dwell. Within this hour the whoobub  
Will be all o'er the prison. I am then  
Kissing the man they look for. Farewell, father;  
Get many more such prisoners and such daughters,  
And shortly you may keep yourself. Now to him!

*Exit.*

## ACT III

### SCENE I: A Forest Near Athens

*Enter Arcite alone.*

**ARCITE**  
The Duke has lost Hippolyta; each took  
A several land. This is a solemn rite  
They owe bloom'd May, and the Athenians pay it  
To th' heart of ceremony. O queen Emilia,  
Fresher than May, sweeter  
Than her gold buttons on the boughs, or all  
Th' enamell'd knacks o' th' mead or garden! Yea  
(We challenge too) the bank of any nymph,  
That makes the stream seem flowers! Thou, O jewel  
With thy sole presence. In thy rumination  
That I, poor man, might eftsoons come between  
And chop on some cold thought! Thrice-blessed chance,  
To drop on such a mistress, expectation  
Most guiltless on't. Tell me, O Lady Fortune  
I may be proud. She takes strong note of me,  
Hath made me near her; and this beauteous morn  
(The prim'st of all the year) presents me with  
A brace of horses; two such steeds might well  
Be by a pair of kings back'd, in a field  
That their crowns' titles tried. Alas, alas,  
Poor cousin Palamon, poor prisoner, thou  
So little dream'st upon my fortune that  
Thou think'st thyself the happier thing to be  
So near Emilia. Me thou deem'st at Thebes,  
And therein wretched, although free. But if  
Thou knew'st my mistress breath'd on me, and that  
I ear'd her language, liv'd in her eye, O coz,  
What passion would enclose thee! /

*Enter Palamon, as out of a bush, with his shackles; bends his fist at Arcite.*

**PALAMON**  
/ Traitor kinsman,  
Thou shouldst perceive my passion, if these signs  
Of prisonment were off me, and this hand  
But owner of a sword! Had I a sword,  
And these house-clogs away-- /

**ARCITE**  
/ Dear cousin Palamon--

**PALAMON**  
Cozener Arcite, give me language such  
As thou hast show'd me feat. /

**ARCITE**  
/ Not finding in  
The circuit of my breast any gross stuff  
To form me like your blazon, holds me to  
This gentleness of answer: 'tis your passion  
That thus mistakes, the which to you being enemy,  
Cannot to me be kind. Honor and honesty  
I cherish and depend on, howsoev'r  
You skip them in me, and with them, fair coz,  
I'll maintain my proceedings. Pray be pleas'd  
To show in generous terms your griefs. /

**PALAMON**  
/ Sir,  
I have seen you move in such a place which well  
Might justify your manhood; you were call'd  
A good knight and a bold. But the whole week's not fair  
If any day it rain. Their valiant temper  
Men lose when they incline to treachery,  
And then they fight like compell'd bears, would fly  
Were they not tied. /

**ARCITE**  
/ Kinsman, you might as well  
Speak this and act it in your glass, as to  
His ear which now disdains you. /

**PALAMON**  
/ Come up to me,  
Quit me of these cold gyves, give me a sword  
Though it be rusty, and the charity  
Of one meal lend me; come before me then,  
A good sword in thy hand, and do but say  
That Emily is thine, I will forgive  
The trespass thou hast done me, yea, my life  
If then thou carry't, and brave souls in shades  
That have died manly, which will seek of me  
Some news from earth, they shall get none but this--  
That thou art brave and noble. /

**ARCITE**  
/ Be content,  
Again betake you to your hawthorn house.  
With counsel of the night, I will be here  
With wholesome viands; these impediments  
Will I file off; you shall have garments, and  
When you shall stretch yourself, and say but, "Arcite,  
I am in plight," there shall be at your choice  
Both sword and armor. /

**PALAMON**  
/ O you heavens, dares any  
So noble bear a guilty business? None  
But only Arcite; therefore none but Arcite  
In this kind is so bold. /

**ARCITE**  
/ Sweet Palamon--

**PALAMON**  
I do embrace you and your offer. For  
Your offer do't I only, sir; your person  
Without hypocrisy I may not wish  
More than my sword's edge on't. /

*Wind horns off. Cornets.*

**ARCITE**  
/ You hear the horns:  
Enter your musit, lest this match between 's  
Be cross'd ere met. Give me your hand, farewell.  
I'll bring you every needful thing. I pray you  
Take comfort and be strong. /

**PALAMON**  
/ Pray hold your promise;  
And do the deed with a bent brow. Most certain  
You love me not; be rough with me, and pour  
This oil out of your language. By this air,  
I could for each word give a cuff, my stomach  
Not reconcil'd by reason. /

**ARCITE**  
/ Plainly spoken,  
Yet pardon me hard language. When I spur  
My horse, I chide him not; content and anger  
In me have but one face. /

*Wind horns within.*

/ Hark, sir, they call  
The scatter'd to the banquet. You must guess  
I have an office there. /

**PALAMON**  
/ Sir, your attendance  
Cannot please heaven, and I know your office  
Unjustly is achiev'd. But this one word:  
You are going now to gaze upon my mistress,  
For note you, mine she is-- /

**ARCITE**  
/ Nay then-- /

**PALAMON**  
/ Nay, pray you--  
You talk of feeding me to breed me strength;  
You are going now to look upon a sun  
That strengthens what it looks on; there you have  
A vantage o'er me, but enjoy't till  
I may enforce my remedy. Farewell.

*Exeunt severally.*

### SCENE II: Another Part of the Forest Near Athens

*Enter Jailer's Daughter alone.*

**DAUGHTER**  
He has mistook the brake I meant, is gone  
After his fancy. 'Tis now well-nigh morning;  
No matter, would it were perpetual night,  
And darkness lord o' th' world! Hark, 'tis a wolf!  
In me hath grief slain fear, and but for one thing,  
I care for nothing, and that's Palamon.  
I reck not if the wolves would jaw me, so  
He had this file. I have heard  
Strange howls this livelong night; why may't not be  
They have made prey of him? He has no weapons,  
He cannot run, the jingling of his gyves  
Might call fell things to listen, who have in them  
A sense to know a man unarm'd, and can  
Smell where resistance is. I'll set it down  
He's torn to pieces. They howl'd many together,  
And then they fed on him. How stand I then?  
Food took I none these two days--  
Sipp'd some water. I have not clos'd mine eyes  
Save when my lids scour'd off their brine. Alas,  
Dissolve, my life, let not my sense unsettle  
Lest I should drown, or stab, or hang myself.  
The moon is down, the crickets chirp, the screech owl  
Calls in the dawn! All offices are done  
Save what I fail in. But the point is this--  
An end, and that is all.

*Exit.*

### SCENE III: Another Part of the Forest Near Athens.

*Enter Arcite with meat, wine, and files.*

**ARCITE**  
I should be near the place. Ho, cousin Palamon!

*Enter Palamon.*

**PALAMON**  
Arcite? /

**ARCITE**  
/ The same. I have brought you food and files.  
Come forth and fear not, here's no Theseus.

**PALAMON**  
Nor none so honest, Arcite. /

**ARCITE**  
/ That's no matter,  
We'll argue that hereafter. Come, take courage,  
You shall not die thus beastly. Here, sir, drink--  
I know you are faint--then I'll talk further with you.

**PALAMON**  
Arcite, thou mightst now poison me. /

**ARCITE**  
/ I might;  
But I must fear you first. Sit down, and good now  
No more of these vain parleys; let us not,  
Make talk for fools and cowards. To your health, etc.

*Drinks.*

**PALAMON**  
Do. /

**ARCITE**  
/ Pray sit down then, and let me entreat you  
By all the honesty and honor in you,  
No mention of this woman. 'Twill disturb us,  
We shall have time enough. /

**PALAMON**  
/ Well, sir, I'll pledge you.

*Drinks.*

**ARCITE**  
The duke has more, coz, eat now. /

**PALAMON**  
/ Yes. /

*Eats.*

**ARCITE**  
/ I am glad  
You have so good a stomach. /

**PALAMON**  
/ I am gladder  
I have so good meat to't. /

**ARCITE**  
/ Is't not mad lodging  
Here in the wild woods, cousin? /

**PALAMON**  
/ Yes, for them  
That have wild consciences. /

**ARCITE**  
/ How tastes your victuals?

**PALAMON**  
What is this? /

**ARCITE**  
/ Venison. /

**PALAMON**  
/ 'Tis a lusty meat.  
Give me more wine. Here, Arcite, to the wenches  
We have known in our days! The Lord Steward's daughter--  
Do you remember her? /

**ARCITE**  
/ After you, coz.

**PALAMON**  
She lov'd a black-hair'd man. /

**ARCITE**  
/ She did so; well, sir?

**PALAMON**  
And I have heard some call him Arcite, and--

**ARCITE**  
Out with't, faith! /

**PALAMON**  
/ She met him in an arbor:  
What did she there, coz? Play o' th' virginals?

**ARCITE**  
Something she did, sir. /

**PALAMON**  
/ Made her groan a month for't.  
There's nothing in thee honest. /

**ARCITE**  
/ Then I'll leave you;  
You are a beast now. /

**PALAMON**  
/ As thou mak'st me, traitor!

**ARCITE**  
There's all things needful, files and shirts and perfumes.  
I'll come again some two hours hence and bring  
That that shall quiet all. /

**PALAMON**  
/ A sword and armor.

**ARCITE**  
Fear me not. You are now too foul; farewell.  
Get off your trinkets, you shall want nought. /

**PALAMON**  
/ Sirrah--

**ARCITE**  
I'll hear no more. /

*Exit.*

**PALAMON**  
/ If he keep touch, he dies for't.

*Exit.*

### SCENE IV: Another Part of the Forest Near Athens

*Enter Jailer's Daughter.*

**DAUGHTER**  
Yonder's the sea, and there's a ship. How't tumbles!  
And there's a rock lies watching under water;  
Now, now, it beats upon it--now, now, now!  
There's a leak sprung, a sound one. How they cry!  
Open her before the wind! You'll lose all else.  
Up with a course or two, and tack about, boys!  
Good night, good night, y' are gone. I am very hungry.

*Exit.*

### SCENE VI: Another Part of the Forest Near Athens

*Enter Palamon from the bush.*

**PALAMON**  
About this hour my cousin gave his faith  
To visit me again, and with him bring  
Two swords and two good armors. If he fail,  
He's neither man nor soldier. When he left me,  
I did not think a week could have restor'd  
My lost strength to me, I was grown so low  
And crestfall'n with my wants. I thank thee, Arcite,  
Thou art yet a fair foe; and I feel myself,  
With this refreshing, able once again  
To out-dure danger. To delay it longer  
Would make the world think, when it comes to hearing,  
That I lay fatting like a swine, to fight,  
And not a soldier: therefore this blest morning  
Shall be the last; and that sword he refuses,  
If it but hold, I kill him with. 'Tis justice.  
So, love and fortune for me! /

*Enter Arcite with armors and swords.*

/ O, good morrow.

**ARCITE**  
Good morrow, noble kinsman. /

**PALAMON**  
/ I have put you  
To too much pains, sir. /

**ARCITE**  
/ That too much, fair cousin,  
Is but a debt to honor, and my duty.

**PALAMON**  
Would you were so in all, sir! I could wish ye  
As kind a kinsman as you force me find  
A beneficial foe, that my embraces  
Might thank ye, not my blows. /

**ARCITE**  
/ I shall think either,  
Well done, a noble recompense. /

**PALAMON**  
/ Then I shall quit you.

**ARCITE**  
Defy me in these fair terms, and you show  
More than a mistress to me; no more anger,  
As you love anything that's honorable.  
We were not bred to talk, man. When we are arm'd  
And both upon our guards, then let our fury,  
Like meeting of two tides, fly strongly from us,  
And then to whom the birthright of this beauty  
Truly pertains (without obbraidings, scorns,  
Despisings of our persons, and such poutings,  
Fitter for girls and schoolboys) will be seen,  
And quickly, yours or mine. Will't please you arm, sir?  
Or if you feel yourself not fitting yet  
And furnish'd with your old strength, I'll stay, cousin,  
And ev'ry day discourse you into health,  
As I am spar'd. Your person I am friends with,  
And I could wish I had not said I lov'd her,  
Though I had died; but loving such a lady  
And justifying my love, I must not fly from't.

**PALAMON**  
Arcite, thou art so brave an enemy  
That no man but thy cousin's fit to kill thee.  
I am well and lusty, choose your arms. /

**ARCITE**  
/ Choose you, sir.

**PALAMON**  
Wilt thou exceed in all, or dost thou do it  
To make me spare thee? /

**ARCITE**  
/ If you think so, cousin,  
You are deceived, for as I am a soldier,  
I will not spare you. /

**PALAMON**  
/ That's well said. /

**ARCITE**  
/ You'll find it.

**PALAMON**  
Then as I am an honest man, and love  
With all the justice of affection,  
I'll pay thee soundly. This I'll take. /

**ARCITE**  
/ That's mine then.  
I'll arm you first. /

**PALAMON**  
/ Do. Pray thee tell me, cousin,  
Where got'st thou this good armor? /

**ARCITE**  
/ 'Tis the Duke's,  
And to say true, I stole it. Do I pinch you? /

**PALAMON**  
/ No.

**ARCITE**  
Is't not too heavy? /

**PALAMON**  
/ I have worn a lighter,  
But I shall make it serve. /

**ARCITE**  
/ I'll buckle't close.

**PALAMON**  
By any means. /

**ARCITE**  
/ You care not for a grand-guard?

**PALAMON**  
No, no, we'll use no horses. I perceive  
You would fain be at that fight. /

**ARCITE**  
/ I am indifferent.

**ARCITE**  
Will you fight bare-arm'd? /

**PALAMON**  
/ We shall be the nimbler.

**ARCITE**  
But use your gauntlets though. Those are o' th' least;  
Prithee take mine, good cousin. /

**PALAMON**  
/ Now to you, sir.  
Methinks this armor's very like that, Arcite,  
Thou wor'st that day the three kings fell, but lighter.

**ARCITE**  
That was a very good one, and that day,  
I well remember, you outdid me, cousin;  
I never saw such valor. When you charg'd  
Upon the left wing of the enemy,  
I spurr'd hard to come up, and under me  
I had a right good horse.

**PALAMON**  
You are modest, cousin. /

**ARCITE**  
/ When I saw you charge first,  
Methought I heard a dreadful clap of thunder  
Break from the troop. /

**PALAMON**  
/ But still before that flew  
The lightning of your valor. Stay a little;  
Is not this piece too strait? /

**ARCITE**  
/ No, no, 'tis well.

**PALAMON**  
I would have nothing hurt thee but my sword,  
A bruise would be dishonor. /

**ARCITE**  
/ Now I am perfect.

**PALAMON**  
Stand off then. /

**ARCITE**  
/ Take my sword, I hold it better.

**PALAMON**  
I thank ye. No, keep it, your life lies on it.  
Here's one, if it but hold, I ask no more  
For all my hopes. My cause and honor guard me!

**ARCITE**  
And me my love! /

*They bow several ways; then advance and stand.*

/ Is there aught else to say?

**PALAMON**  
This only, and no more: thou art mine aunt's son,  
And that blood we desire to shed is mutual,  
In me, thine, and in thee, mine. My sword  
Is in my hand, and if thou kill'st me,  
The gods and I forgive thee. If there be  
A place prepar'd for those that sleep in honor,  
I wish his weary soul that falls may win it.  
Fight bravely, cousin. Give me thy noble hand.

**ARCITE**  
Here, Palamon: this hand shall never more  
Come near thee with such friendship. /

**PALAMON**  
/ I commend thee.

**ARCITE**  
If I fall, curse me, and say I was a coward,  
For none but such dare die in these just trials.  
Once more farewell, my cousin. /

**PALAMON**  
/ Farewell, Arcite.

*Fight. Horns within; they stand.*

**ARCITE**  
Lo, cousin, lo, our folly has undone us.

**PALAMON**  
Why? /

**ARCITE**  
/ This is the Duke, a-hunting as I know it.  
If we be found, we are wretched. O, retire  
For honor's sake, and safely presently  
Into your bush again, sir. We shall find  
Too many hours to die in, gentle cousin.  
If you be seen, you perish instantly  
For breaking prison, and I, if you reveal me,  
For my contempt. Then all the world will scorn us,  
And say we had a noble difference,  
But base disposers of it. /

**PALAMON**  
/ No, no, cousin,  
I will no more be hidden, nor put off  
This great adventure to a second trial.  
I know your cunning, and I know your cause.  
He that faints now, shame take him! Put thyself  
Upon thy present guard-- /

**ARCITE**  
/ You are not mad?

**PALAMON**  
I love Emilia, and in that I'll bury  
Thee and all crosses else. /

**ARCITE**  
/ Then come what can come,  
Thou shalt know, Palamon, I dare as well  
Die as discourse or sleep. Only this fears me,  
The law will have the honor of our ends.  
Have at thy life! /

**PALAMON**  
/ Look to thine own well, Arcite.

*Fight again. Horns.*

*Enter Theseus, Hippolyta, Emilia, and Pirithous*

**THESEUS**  
What ignorant and mad malicious traitors  
Are you, that 'gainst the tenor of my laws  
Are making battle, thus like knights appointed,  
Without my leave and officers of arms?  
By Castor, both shall die. /

**PALAMON**  
/ Hold thy word, Theseus.  
We are certainly both traitors, both despisers  
Of thee and of thy goodness. I am Palamon,  
That cannot love thee, he that broke thy prison--  
Think well what that deserves; and this is Arcite,  
A bolder traitor never trod thy ground,  
A falser nev'r seem'd friend. This is the man  
Was begg'd and banish'd, this is he contemns thee  
And what thou dar'st do; and in this disguise,  
Against thy own edict, follows thy sister,  
That fortunate bright star, the fair Emilia,  
Whose servant (if there be a right in seeing,  
And first bequeathing of the soul to) justly  
I am, and which is more, dares think her his.  
This treachery, like a most trusty lover,  
I call'd him now to answer. If thou be'st,  
As thou art spoken, great and virtuous,  
The true decider of all injuries,  
Say, "Fight again!" and thou shalt see me, Theseus,  
Do such a justice thou thyself wilt envy.  
Then take my life, I'll woo thee to't. /

**PIRITHOUS**  
/ O heaven,  
What more than man is this! /

**THESEUS**  
/ I have sworn. /

**ARCITE**  
/ We seek not  
Thy breath of mercy, Theseus. 'Tis to me  
A thing as soon to die as thee to say it,  
And no more mov'd. Where this man calls me traitor,  
Let me say thus much: if in love be treason  
In service of so excellent a beauty,  
So let me be most traitor, and ye please me.  
For scorning thy edict, Duke, ask that lady  
Why she is fair, and why her eyes command me  
Stay here to love her; and if she say "traitor,"  
I am a villain fit to lie unburied.

**PALAMON**  
Thou shalt have pity of us both, O Theseus,  
If unto neither thou show mercy. Stop,  
As thou art just, thy noble ear against us;  
Let 's die together, at one instant, Duke.  
Only a little let him fall before me,  
That I may tell my soul he shall not have her.

**THESEUS**  
I grant your wish, for to say true, your cousin  
Has ten times more offended, for I gave him  
More mercy than you found, sir, your offenses  
Being no more than his. None here speak for 'em,  
For ere the sun set, both shall sleep forever.

**HIPPOLYTA**  
Alas, the pity! Now or never, sister,  
Speak, not to be denied. That face of yours  
Will bear the curses else of after-ages  
For these lost cousins. /

**EMILIA**  
/ In my face, dear sister,  
I find no anger to 'em, nor no ruin.  
Help me, dear sister, in a deed so virtuous  
The powers of all women will be with us.  
Most royal brother-- /

*They kneel.*

**HIPPOLYTA**  
/ Sir, by our tie of marriage--

**EMILIA**  
By your own spotless honor-- /

**HIPPOLYTA**  
/ By that faith,  
That fair hand, and that honest heart you gave me--

**THESEUS**  
These are strange conjurings. /

**PIRITHOUS**  
/ Nay then I'll in too.

*\[Kneels.]*  
By all our friendship, sir, by all our dangers,  
By all you love most--wars, and this sweet lady--  
To crown all this, by your most noble soul,  
Which cannot want due mercy, I beg first.

**HIPPOLYTA**  
Next hear my prayers. /

**EMILIA**  
/ Last let me entreat, sir.

**PIRITHOUS**  
For mercy. /

**HIPPOLYTA**  
/ Mercy. /

**EMILIA**  
/ Mercy on these princes.

**THESEUS**  
Ye make my faith reel. Say I felt  
Compassion to 'em both, how would you place it?

**EMILIA**  
Upon their lives; but with their banishments.

**THESEUS**  
You are a right woman, sister, you have pity,  
But want the understanding where to use it.  
If you desire their lives, invent a way  
Safer than banishment. Can these two live,  
And have the agony of love about 'em,  
And not kill one another? Every day  
They'd fight about you; hourly bring your honor  
In public question with their swords. Be wise then  
And here forget 'em; it concerns your credit  
And my oath equally. I have said they die;  
Better they fall by th' law than one another.  
Bow not my honor. /

**EMILIA**  
/ O my noble brother,  
That oath was rashly made, and in your anger,  
Your reason will not hold it. If such vows  
Stand for express will, all the world must perish.  
Beside, I have another oath 'gainst yours,  
Of more authority, I am sure more love,  
Not made in passion neither, but good heed.

**THESEUS**  
What is it, sister? /

**PIRITHOUS**  
/ Urge it home, brave lady.

**EMILIA**  
That you would nev'r deny me anything  
Fit for my modest suit and your free granting.  
I tie you to your word now; if ye fall in't,  
Think how you maim your honor  
(For now I am set a-begging, sir, I am deaf  
To all but your compassion), how their lives  
Might breed the ruin of my name; opinion,  
Shall anything that loves me perish for me?  
That were a cruel wisdom. Do men proin  
The straight young boughs that blush with thousand blossoms,  
Because they may be rotten? O Duke Theseus,  
The goodly mothers that have groan'd for these,  
And all the longing maids that ever lov'd,  
If your vow stand, shall curse me and my beauty,  
And in their funeral songs for these two cousins  
Despise my cruelty, and cry woe worth me,  
Till I am nothing but the scorn of women.  
For heaven's sake save their lives, and banish 'em.

**THESEUS**  
On what conditions? /

**EMILIA**  
/ Swear 'em never more  
To make me their contention, or to know me,  
To tread upon thy dukedom, and to be,  
Where ever they shall travel, ever strangers  
To one another. /

**PALAMON**  
/ I'll be cut a-pieces  
Before I take this oath. Forget I love her?  
O all ye gods, despise me then. Thy banishment  
I not mislike, so we may fairly carry  
Our swords and cause along; else, never trifle,  
But take our lives, Duke. I must love, and will,  
And for that love must and dare kill this cousin,  
On any piece the earth has. /

**THESEUS**  
/ Will you, Arcite,  
Take these conditions? /

**PALAMON**  
/ He's a villain then.

**PIRITHOUS**  
These are men!

**ARCITE**  
No, never. Duke. 'Tis worse to me than begging  
To take my life so basely. Though I think  
I never shall enjoy her, yet I'll preserve  
The honor of affection, and die for her,  
Make death a devil.

**THESEUS**  
What may be done? For now I feel compassion.

**PIRITHOUS**  
Let it not fall again, sir. /

**THESEUS**  
/ Say, Emilia,  
If one of them were dead, as one must, are you  
Content to take th' other to your husband?  
They cannot both enjoy you.  Make choice then.

**EMILIA**  
I cannot, sir, they are both too excellent:  
For me, a hair shall never fall of these men.

**HIPPOLYTA**  
What will become of 'em? /

**THESEUS**  
/ Thus I ordain it,  
And by mine honor, once again it stands,  
Or both shall die: you shall both to your country,  
And each within this month, accompanied  
With two fair knights, appear again in this place,  
In which I'll plant a pyramid; and whether,  
Before us that are here, can force his cousin  
By fair and knightly strength to touch the pillar,  
He shall enjoy her; the other lose his head,  
And all his friends; nor shall he grudge to fall,  
Nor think he dies with interest in this lady.  
Will this content ye? /

**PALAMON**  
/ Yes. Here, cousin Arcite,  
I am friends again till that hour. /

**ARCITE**  
/ I embrace ye.

**THESEUS**  
Are you content, sister? /

**EMILIA**  
/ Yes, I must, sir,  
Else both miscarry. /

**THESEUS**  
/ Come shake hands again then,  
And take heed, as you are gentlemen, this quarrel  
Sleep till the hour prefix'd, and hold your course.

**PALAMON**  
We dare not fail thee, Theseus. /

**THESEUS**  
/ Come, I'll give ye  
Now usage like to princes and to friends.  
When ye return, who wins I'll settle here;  
Who loses, yet I'll weep upon his bier.

*Exeunt.*

## INTERMISSION

## ACT IV

### SCENE I: Athens. A Room in the Prison.

*Enter Jailer and his Friend one way, another a separate way.*

**SECOND FRIEND**  
Be of good comfort, man; I bring you news,  
Good news. /

**JAILER**  
/ They are welcome. /

**SECOND FRIEND**  
/ Palamon has clear'd you,  
And got your pardon, and discover'd how  
And by whose means he escap'd, which was your daughter's,  
Whose pardon is procur'd too; and the prisoner--  
Not to be held ungrateful to her goodness--  
Has given a sum of money to her marriage,  
A large one, I'll assure you. /

**JAILER**  
/ Ye are a good man  
And ever bring good news. /

**FIRST FRIEND**  
/ How was it ended?

**SECOND FRIEND**  
Why, as it should be: they that nev'r begg'd  
But they prevail'd, had their suits fairly granted:  
The prisoners have their lives. /

**FIRST FRIEND**  
/ I knew 'twould be so.

*Enter Wooer.*

**WOOER**  
Alas, sir, where's your daughter? /

**JAILER**  
/ Why do you ask?

**WOOER**  
O sir, when did you see her? /

**SECOND FRIEND**  
/ How he looks!

**JAILER**  
This morning. /

**WOOER**  
/ Was she well? Was she in health?  
Sir, when did she sleep? /

**FIRST FRIEND**  
/ These are strange questions.

**JAILER**  
I do not think she was very well, for, now  
You make me mind her, but this very day  
I ask'd her questions, and she answered me  
So far from what she was, so childishly,  
So sillily, as if she were a fool,  
An innocent, and I was very angry.  
But what of her, sir? /

**WOOER**  
/ Nothing but my pity.  
But you must know it, and as good by me  
As by another that less loves her. /

**JAILER**  
/ Well, sir?

**FIRST FRIEND**  
Not right? /

**SECOND FRIEND**  
/ Not well? /

**WOOER**  
/ No, sir, not well:  
'Tis too true, she is mad. /

**FIRST FRIEND**  
/ It cannot be.

**WOOER**  
Believe you'll find it so. /

**JAILER**  
/ I half suspected  
What you told me. The gods comfort her!  
Either this was her love to Palamon,  
Or fear of my miscarrying on his scape,  
Or both.

**WOOER**  
/ 'Tis likely. /

**JAILER**  
/ But why all this haste, sir?

**WOOER**  
I'll tell you quickly. As I late was angling  
In the great lake that lies behind the palace,  
I heard a voice, a shrill one; and attentive  
I gave my ear, when I might well perceive  
'Twas one that sung, and by the smallness of it,  
A boy or woman. I then left my angle  
To his own skill, came near, but yet perceiv'd not  
Who made the sound, the rushes and the reeds  
Had so encompass'd it. I laid me down  
And list'ned to the words she sung, for then  
Through a small glade cut by the fishermen,  
I saw it was your daughter. /

**JAILER**  
/ Pray go on, sir.

**WOOER**  
She sung much, but no sense; only I heard her  
Repeat this often, "Palamon is gone,  
Is gone to th' wood to gather mulberries.  
I'll find him out tomorrow." /

**FIRST FRIEND**  
/ Pretty soul!

**WOOER**  
"His shackles will betray him, he'll be taken."

**SECOND FRIEND**  
Alas, what pity it is! /

**WOOER**  
/ I made in to her.  
She saw me, and straight sought the flood. I sav'd her,  
And set her safe to land; when presently  
She slipp'd away, and to the city made  
With such a cry and swiftness that, believe me,  
She left me far behind her. Three or four  
I saw from far off cross her--one of 'em  
I knew to be your brother; where she stay'd,  
And fell, scarce to be got away. I left them with her,  
And hither came to tell you. /

*Enter Jailer's Brother, and Daughter.*

/ Here they are.

**DAUGHTER**  
*\[Sings]*  
"May you never more enjoy the light," etc.  
Is not this a fine song? /

**JAILER'S BROTHER**  
/ O, a very fine one!

**DAUGHTER**  
I can sing twenty more. /

**JAILER'S BROTHER**  
/ I think you can.

**DAUGHTER**  
Yes, truly, can I. I can sing "The Broom,"  
And "Bonny Robin." Are not you a tailor?

**JAILER'S BROTHER**  
Yes. /

**DAUGHTER**  
/ Where's my wedding gown? /

**JAILER'S SISTER**  
/ I'll bring it tomorrow.

**DAUGHTER**  
Do, very rearly, I must be abroad else,  
To call the maids and pay the minstrels,  
For I must lose my maidenhead by cocklight,  
'Twill never thrive else.

*Sings.*

"O fair, O sweet," etc.

**JAILER'S BROTHER**  
You must ev'n take it patiently. /

**JAILER**  
/ 'Tis true.

**DAUGHTER**  
Good ev'n, good men. Pray did you ever hear  
Of one young Palamon? /

**JAILER**  
/ Yes, wench, we know him.

**DAUGHTER**  
Is't not a fine young gentleman? /

**JAILER**  
/ 'Tis, love.

**JAILER'S BROTHER**  
By no mean cross her, she is then distemper'd  
Far worse than now she shows. /

**FIRST FRIEND**  
/ Yes, he's a fine man.

**DAUGHTER**  
O, is he so? You have a sister? /

**FIRST FRIEND**  
/ Yes.

**DAUGHTER**  
But she shall never have him, tell her so.  
There is at least two hundred now with child by him--  
There must be four. Yet I keep close for all this,  
Close as a cockle. And all these must be boys,  
He has the trick on't; and at ten years old  
They must be all gelt for musicians,  
And sing the wars of Theseus. /

**SECOND FRIEND**  
/ This is strange.

**DAUGHTER**  
As ever you heard, but say nothing. /

**FIRST FRIEND**  
/ No.

**DAUGHTER**  
They come from all parts of the dukedom to him.  
I'll warrant ye he had not so few last night  
As twenty to dispatch. He'll tickle't up  
In two hours, if his hand be in. /

**JAILER**  
/ She's lost  
Past all cure. /

**JAILER'S BROTHER**  
/ Heaven forbid, man!

**DAUGHTER**

*To the Jailer.*

Come hither, you are a wise man. /

**FIRST FRIEND**  
/ Does she know him?

**SECOND FRIEND**  
No, would she did! /

**DAUGHTER**  
/ You are master of a ship?

**JAILER**  
Yes. /

**DAUGHTER**  
/ Where's your compass? /

**JAILER**  
/ Here. /

**DAUGHTER**  
/ Set it to th' north.  
And now direct your course to th' wood, where Palamon  
Lies longing for me. For the tackling  
Let me alone. Come weigh, my hearts, cheerly!

**ALL**  
Owgh, owgh, owgh! 'Tis up! The wind's fair.  
Top the bowling! Out with the mainsail!  
Where's your whistle, master? /

**DAUGHTER**  
/ Tack about!

*Sings.*

"When Cynthia with her borrowed light," etc.

*Exeunt.*

### SCENE II: A Room in the Palace.

*Enter Emilia alone, with two pictures.*

**EMILIA**  
Yet I may bind those wounds up, that must open  
And bleed to death for my sake else. I'll choose,  
And end their strife. Two such young handsome men  
Shall never fall for me; their weeping mothers,  
Following the dead-cold ashes of their sons,  
Shall never curse my cruelty. Good heaven,  
What a sweet face has Arcite! If wise Nature,  
With all her best endowments, all those beauties  
She sows into the births of noble bodies,  
Were here a mortal woman, and had in her  
The coy denials of young maids, yet doubtless  
She would run mad for this man. What an eye,  
Of what a fiery sparkle and quick sweetness,  
Has this young prince! Here Love himself sits smiling.  
Just such another wanton Ganymede  
Set Jove afire with, and enforc'd the god  
Snatch up the goodly boy and set him by him,  
A shining constellation. What a brow,  
Of what a spacious majesty, he carries,  
Arch'd like the great-ey'd Juno's, but far sweeter,  
Smoother than Pelops' shoulder! Fame and Honor  
Methinks from hence, as from a promontory  
Pointed in heaven, should clap their wings and sing  
To all the under world the loves and fights  
Of gods and such men near 'em. Palamon  
Is but his foil, to him, a mere dull shadow;  
He's swarth and meagre, of an eye as heavy  
As if he had lost his mother; a still temper,  
No stirring in him, no alacrity,  
Of all this sprightly sharpness, not a smile.  
Yet these that we count errors may become him:  
Narcissus was a sad boy, but a heavenly.  
O, who can find the bent of woman's fancy?  
I am a fool, my reason is lost in me;  
I have no choice, and I have lied so lewdly  
That women ought to beat me. On my knees  
I ask thy pardon: Palamon, thou art alone  
And only beautiful, and these the eyes,  
These the bright lamps of beauty, that command  
And threaten Love, and what young maid dare cross 'em?  
What a bold gravity, and yet inviting,  
Has this brown manly face! O Love, this only  
From this hour is complexion. Lie there, Arcite,  
Thou art a changeling to him, a mere gypsy,  
And this the noble body. I am sotted,  
Utterly lost. My virgin's faith has fled me;  
For if my brother but even now had ask'd me  
Whether I lov'd, I had run mad for Arcite;  
Now if my sister--more for Palamon.  
Stand both together: now, come ask me, brother--  
Alas, I know not! Ask me now, sweet sister--  
I may go look! What a mere child is fancy,  
That having two fair gauds of equal sweetness,  
Cannot distinguish, but must cry for both!

*Enter Gentleman.*

How now, sir? /

**GENTLEMAN**  
/ From the noble Duke your brother,  
Madam, I bring you news. The knights are come.

**EMILIA**  
To end the quarrel? /

**GENTLEMAN**  
/ Yes. /

*Exit Gentleman*

**EMILIA**  
/ Would I might end first!  
What sins have I committed, chaste Diana,  
That my unspotted youth must now be soil'd  
With blood of princes? And my chastity  
Be made the altar where the lives of lovers--  
Two greater and two better never yet  
Made mothers joy--must be the sacrifice  
To my unhappy beauty? /

*Enter Theseus, Hippolyta, and Pirithous*

**THESEUS**  
/ Bring 'em in  
Quickly, by any means, I long to see 'em.--  
Your two contending lovers are return'd,  
And with them their fair knights. Now, my fair sister,  
You must love one of them. /

**EMILIA**  
/ I had rather both,  
So neither for my sake should fall untimely.

**THESEUS**  
Lady, you shall see men fight now. /

**HIPPOLYTA**  
/ I wish it,  
But not the cause, my lord. They would show  
Bravely about the titles of two kingdoms.  
'Tis pity love should be so tyrannous.  
O my soft-hearted sister, what think you?  
Weep not, till they weep blood. Wench, it must be.

**THESEUS**  
You have steel'd 'em with your beauty.--Honor'd friend,  
To you I give the field; pray order it,  
Fitting the persons that must use it. /

**PIRITHOUS**  
/ Yes, sir.

**THESEUS**  
Come, I'll go visit 'em. I cannot stay--  
Their fame has fir'd me so--till they appear.  
Good friend, be royal. /

**PIRITHOUS**  
/ There shall want no bravery.

**EMILIA**  
Poor wench, go weep, for whosoever wins  
Loses a noble cousin for thy sins.

*Exeunt.*

### SCENE III: A Room in the Prison.

*Enter Jailer, Wooer, Doctor.*

**JAILER**  
What think you of her, sir?

**DOCTOR**  
I think she has a perturb'd mind, which I cannot minister to.

**JAILER**  
Alas, what then?

**DOCTOR**  
Understand you she ever affected any man ere she beheld
Palamon?

**JAILER**  
I was once, sir, in great hope she had fix'd her liking on this
gentleman, my friend.

**WOOER**  
I did think so too, and would account I had a great penn'worth
on't to give half my state that both she and I at this present
stood unfeignedly on the same terms.

**DOCTOR**  
That intemp'rate surfeit of her eye hath distemper'd the other
senses. They may return and settle again to execute their
preordain'd faculties, but they are now in a most extravagant
vagary. This you must do: confine her to a place where the light
may rather seem to steal in than be permitted. Take upon you,
young sir her friend, the name of Palamon, say you come to eat
with her, and to commune of love. This will catch her attention,
for this her mind beats upon; other objects that are inserted
'tween her mind and eye become the pranks and friskins of her
madness. Sing to her such green songs of love as she says
Palamon hath sung in prison. Come to her, stuck in as sweet
flowers as the season is mistress of, and thereto make an
addition of some other compounded odors which are grateful
to the sense. All this shall become Palamon, for Palamon can
sing, and Palamon is sweet, and ev'ry good thing. It is a falsehood
she is in, which is with falsehoods to be combated. This may bring
her to eat, to sleep, and reduce what's now out of square in her
into their former law and regiment. I have seen it approv'd, how
many times I know not, but to make the number more I have great
hope in this. I will, between the passages of this project, come in
with my appliance. Let us put it in execution; and hasten the
success, which doubt not will bring forth comfort.

*Exeunt.*

## ACT V

### SCENE I: Before the Temples of Mars, Venus, and Diana

*Three altars erected--to Mars, Venus, and Diana.*

*Flourish. Enter Theseus, Pirithous, and Hippolyta*

*Flourish of cornets. Enter Palamon and Arcite and their Knights.*

**THESEUS**  
You valiant and strong-hearted enemies,  
You royal germane foes, that this day come  
To blow that nearness out that flames between ye,  
Lay by your anger for an hour, and dove-like,  
Before the holy altars of your helpers,  
The all-fear'd gods, bow down your stubborn bodies.  
Your ire is more than mortal; so your help be;  
And as the gods regard ye, fight with justice.  
I'll leave you to your prayers, and betwixt ye  
I part my wishes. /

**PIRITHOUS**  
/ Honor crown the worthiest!

*Exeunt Theseus and his Train.*

**PALAMON**  
The glass is running now that cannot finish  
Till one of us expire. Think you but thus,  
That were there aught in me which strove to show  
Mine enemy in this business, were't one eye  
Against another, arm oppress'd by arm,  
I would destroy th' offender, coz, I would,  
Though parcel of myself. Then from this gather  
How I should tender you. /

**ARCITE**  
/ I am in labor  
To push your name, your ancient love, our kindred,  
Out of my memory; and i' th' self-same place  
To seat something I would confound. So hoist we  
The sails that must these vessels port even where  
The heavenly limiter pleases. /

**PALAMON**  
/ You speak well.  
Before I turn, let me embrace thee, cousin.

*They embrace.*

This I shall never do again. /

**ARCITE**  
/ One farewell.

**PALAMON**  
Why, let it be so; farewell, coz. /

**ARCITE**  
/ Farewell, sir.

*Exeunt Palamon and his Knights.*

Knights, kinsmen, lovers, yea, my sacrifices,  
True worshippers of Mars, whose spirit in you  
Expels the seeds of fear, and th' apprehension  
Which still is farther off it, go with me  
Before the god of our profession. There  
Require of him the hearts of lions and  
The breath of tigers, yea, the fierceness too,  
Yea, the speed also--to go on, I mean,  
Else wish we to be snails. You know my prize  
Must be dragg'd out of blood; force and great feat  
Must put my garland on, where she sticks  
The queen of flowers. Our intercession then  
Must be to him that makes the camp a cistern  
Brimm'd with the blood of men. Give me your aid  
And bend your spirits towards him.

*They advance to the altar of Mars and fall on their faces; then kneel.*

Thou mighty one, that with thy power hast turn'd  
Green Neptune into purple; whose approach  
Comets prewarn, whose havoc in vast field  
Unearthed skulls proclaim, whose breath blows down  
The teeming Ceres' foison: me thy pupil,  
Youngest follower of thy drum, instruct this day  
With military skill, that to thy laud  
I may advance my streamer, and by thee  
Be styl'd the lord o' th' day. Give me, great Mars,  
Some token of thy pleasure.

*Here they fall on their faces as formerly, and there is heard clanging of armor, with a short thunder, as the burst of a battle, whereupon they all rise and bow to the altar.*

O great corrector of enormous times,  
Shaker of o'er-rank states, thou grand decider  
Of dusty and old titles, that heal'st with blood  
The earth when it is sick, and cur'st the world  
O' th' plurisy of people! I do take  
Thy signs auspiciously, and in thy name  
To my design march boldly.--Let us go.

*Exeunt.*

*Enter Palamon and his Knights, with the former observance.*

**PALAMON**  
Our stars must glister with new fire, or be  
Today extinct. Our argument is love,  
Which if the goddess of it grant, she gives  
Victory too. Then blend your spirits with mine,  
You whose free nobleness do make my cause  
Your personal hazard. To the goddess Venus  
Commend we our proceeding, and implore  
Her power unto our party.

*Here they advance to the altar of Venus, and fall on their faces; then kneel, as formerly.*

Hail, sovereign queen of secrets, who hast power  
To call the fiercest tyrant from his rage:  
Take to thy grace me thy vow'd soldier.  
I vow that lover never yet made sigh  
Truer than I. O then, most soft sweet goddess,  
Give me the victory of this question, which  
Is true love's merit, and bless me with a sign  
Of thy great pleasure.

*Here music is heard; doves are seen to flutter. They fall again upon their faces, then on their knees.*

O thou that from eleven to ninety reign'st  
In mortal bosoms, whose chase is this world,  
And we in herds thy game, I give thee thanks  
For this fair token, which being laid unto  
Mine innocent true heart, arms in assurance  
My body to this business.--Let us rise  
And bow before the goddess. Time comes on.

*They bow. Exeunt.*

*Still music of records. Enter Emilia in white, her hair about her shoulders, and wearing a wheaten wreath, carrying a silver hind, in which is convey'd incense and sweet odors, which being set upon the altar of Diana; she sets fire to it; then she curtsies and kneel.*

**EMILIA**  
O sacred, shadowy, cold, and constant queen,  
Sweet, solitary, white as chaste, and pure  
As wind-fann'd snow, who to thy female knights  
Allow'st no more blood than will make a blush,  
Which is their order's robe: I here, thy priest,  
Am humbled 'fore thine altar. O, vouchsafe,  
With that thy rare green eye--which never yet  
Beheld thing maculate--look on thy virgin,  
And, sacred silver mistress, lend thine ear  
(Which nev'r heard scurril term, into whose port  
Ne'er ent'red wanton sound) to my petition,  
Season'd with holy fear. This is my last  
Of vestal office; I am bride-habited,  
But maiden-hearted. A husband I have 'pointed,  
But do not know him. Out of two I should  
Choose one, and pray for his success, but I  
Am guiltless of election. Of mine eyes  
Were I to lose one, they are equal precious,  
I could doom neither; that which perish'd should  
Go to't unsentenc'd. Therefore, most modest queen,  
He of the two pretenders that best loves me  
And has the truest title in't, let him  
Take off my wheaten garland, or else grant  
The file and quality I hold I may  
Continue in thy band.

*Here the hind vanishes under the altar, and in the place ascends a rose tree, having one rose upon it.*

See what our general of ebbs and flows  
Out from the bowels of her holy altar  
With sacred act advances: but one rose!  
If well inspir'd, this battle shall confound  
Both these brave knights, and I, a virgin flow'r,  
Must grow alone, unpluck'd.

*Here is heard a sudden twang of instruments, and the rose falls from the tree, which vanishes under the altar.*

The flow'r is fall'n, the tree descends. O mistress,  
Thou here dischargest me. I shall be gather'd,  
I think so, but I know not thine own will:  
Unclasp thy mystery.--I hope she's pleas'd,  
Her signs were gracious.

*She curtsies and exits.*

### SCENE II: A Darkened Room in the Prison

*Enter Doctor, Jailer, and Wooer in habit of Palamon.*

**DOCTOR**  
Has this advice I told you done any good upon her?

**WOOER**  
O, very much; the maids that kept her company  
Have half persuaded her that I am Palamon.  
Within this half hour she came smiling to me,  
And ask'd me what I would eat, and when I would kiss her.  
I told her, presently, and kiss'd her twice.

**DOCTOR**  
'Twas well done. Twenty times had been far better,  
For there the cure lies mainly. /

**WOOER**  
/ Then she told me  
She would watch with me tonight, for well she knew  
What hour my fit would take me. /

**DOCTOR**  
/ Let her do so,  
And when your fit comes, fit her home, and presently.

**WOOER**  
She would have me sing.

**DOCTOR**  
You did so? /

**WOOER**  
/ No. /

**DOCTOR**  
/ 'Twas very ill done then.  
You should observe her ev'ry way. /

**WOOER**  
/ Alas,  
I have no voice, friend, to confirm her that way.

**DOCTOR**  
That's all one, if ye make a noise.  
If she entreat again, do anything,  
Lie with her, if she ask you. /

**JAILER**  
/ Ho there, doctor!

**DOCTOR**  
Yes, in the way of cure. /

**JAILER**  
/ But first, by your leave,  
I' th' way of honesty. /

**DOCTOR**  
/ That's but a niceness.  
Nev'r cast your child away for honesty.  
Cure her first this way; then if she will be honest,  
She has the path before her. /

**JAILER**  
/ Thank ye, doctor.

**DOCTOR**  
Pray bring her in  
And let's see how she is. /

**JAILER**  
/ I will, and tell her  
Her Palamon stays for her; but, doctor,  
Methinks you are i' th' wrong still. /

*Exit Jailer.*

**DOCTOR**  
/ Go, go!  
You fathers are fine fools. Her honesty!  
And we should give her physic till we find that--

**WOOER**  
Why, do you think she is not honest, sir?

**DOCTOR**  
How old is she? /

**WOOER**  
/ She's eighteen. /

**DOCTOR**  
/ She may be,  
But that's all one, 'tis nothing to our purpose.  
What e'er her father says, if you perceive  
Her mood inclining that way that I spoke of,  
Videlicet, the way of flesh--you have me?

**WOOER**  
Yet very well, sir. /

**DOCTOR**  
/ Please her appetite,  
And do it home; it cures her ipso facto  
The melancholy humor that infects her.

**WOOER**  
I am of your mind, doctor.

*Enter Jailer and Daughter.*

**DOCTOR**  
You'll find it so. She comes. Pray humor her.

*Wooer retires.*

**JAILER**  
Come, your love Palamon stays for you, child,  
And has done this long hour, to visit you.

**DAUGHTER**  
I thank him for his gentle patience,  
He's a kind gentleman, and I am much bound to him.  
Did you nev'r see the horse he gave me? /

**JAILER**  
/ Yes.

**DAUGHTER**  
How do you like him? /

**JAILER**  
/ He's a very fair one.

**DAUGHTER**  
You never saw him dance? /

**JAILER**  
/ No. /

**DAUGHTER**  
/ I have often.  
He dances very finely, very comely,  
And for a jig, come cut and long tail to him,  
He turns ye like a top. /

**JAILER**  
/ That's fine indeed.

**DAUGHTER**  
He'll dance the morris twenty mile an hour,  
And that will founder the best hobby-horse  
(If I have any skill) in all the parish,  
And gallops to the tune of "Light a' love."  
What think you of this horse? /

**JAILER**  
/ Having these virtues,  
I think he might be brought to play at tennis.

**DAUGHTER**  
Alas, that's nothing. /

**JAILER**  
/ Can he write and read too?

**DAUGHTER**  
A very fair hand, and casts himself th' accounts  
Of all his hay and provender. That hostler  
Must rise betime that cozens him. You know  
The chestnut mare the Duke has? /

**JAILER**  
/ Very well.

**DAUGHTER**  
She is horribly in love with him, poor beast,  
But he is like his master, coy and scornful.

**JAILER**  
What dowry has she? /

**DAUGHTER**  
/ Some two hundred bottles,  
And twenty strike of oats, but he'll ne'er have her.  
He lisps in 's neighing able to entice  
A miller's mare, he'll be the death of her.

**DOCTOR**  
What stuff she utters!

**JAILER**  
Make curtsy, here your love comes. /

*Wooer comes forward.*

**WOOER**  
/ Pretty soul,  
How do ye? That's a fine maid! There's a curtsy!

**DAUGHTER**  
Yours to command i' th' way of honesty.  
How far is't now to th' end o' th' world, my masters?

**DOCTOR**  
Why, a day's journey, wench. /

**DAUGHTER**  
/ Will you go with me?

**WOOER**  
What shall we do there, wench? /

**DAUGHTER**  
/ Why, play at stoolball:  
What is there else to do? /

**WOOER**  
/ I am content,  
If we shall keep our wedding there. /

**DAUGHTER**  
/ 'Tis true,  
For there, I will assure you, we shall find  
Some blind priest for the purpose that will venture  
To marry us, for here they are nice and foolish.  
Besides, my father must be hang'd tomorrow,  
And that would be a blot i' th' business.  
Are not you Palamon? /

**WOOER**  
/ Do not you know me?

**DAUGHTER**  
Yes, but you care not for me. I have nothing  
But this poor petticoat and two coarse smocks.

**WOOER**  
That's all one, I will have you. /

**DAUGHTER**  
/ Will you surely?

**WOOER**  
Yes, by this fair hand, will I. /

**DAUGHTER**  
/ We'll to bed then.

**WOOER**  
Ev'n when you will. /

*Kisses her.*

**DAUGHTER**  
/ O, sir, you would fain be nibbling.

**WOOER**  
Why do you rub my kiss off? /

**DAUGHTER**  
/ 'Tis a sweet one,  
And will perfume me finely against the wedding.  
Is not this your cousin Arcite? /

**DOCTOR**  
/ Yes, sweet heart,  
And I am glad my cousin Palamon  
Has made so fair a choice. /

**DAUGHTER**  
/ Do you think he'll have me?

**DOCTOR**  
Yes, without doubt. /

**DAUGHTER**  
/ Do you think so too? /

**JAILER**  
/ Yes.

**DAUGHTER**  
We shall have many children.--Lord, how y' are grown!  
My Palamon I hope will grow too, finely,  
Now he's at liberty. Alas, poor chicken,  
He was kept down with hard meat and ill lodging,  
But I'll kiss him up again.

*Enter First Messenger.*

**FIRST MESSENGER**  
What do you here? You'll lose the noblest sight  
That ev'r was seen. /

**JAILER**  
/ Are they i' th' field? /

**FIRST MESSENGER**  
/ They are.  
You bear a charge there too. /

**JAILER**  
/ I'll away straight.  
I must ev'n leave you here. /

**DOCTOR**  
/ Nay, we'll go with you,  
I will not lose the fight. /

**JAILER**  
/ How did you like her?

**DOCTOR**  
I'll warrant you within these three or four days  
I'll make her right again. /

*\[To the Wooer]*  
/ You must not from her,  
But still preserve her in this way. /

**WOOER**  
/ I will.

**DOCTOR**  
Let's get her in. /

**WOOER**  
/ Come, sweet, we'll go to dinner,  
And then we'll play at cards. /

**DAUGHTER**  
/ And shall we kiss too?

**WOOER**  
A hundred times. /

**DAUGHTER**  
/ And twenty? /

**WOOER**  
/ Ay, and twenty.

**DAUGHTER**  
And then we'll sleep together? /

**DOCTOR**  
/ Take her offer.

**WOOER**  
Yes, marry, will we. /

**DAUGHTER**  
/ But you shall not hurt me.

**WOOER**  
I will not, sweet. /

**DAUGHTER**  
/ If you do, love, I'll cry.

*Exeunt.*

### SCENE III: A Place Near the Lists

*Flourish. Enter Theseus, Hippolyta, Emilia, and Pirithous*

**EMILIA**  
I'll no step further. /

**PIRITHOUS**  
/ Will you lose this sight?

**EMILIA**  
I had rather see a wren hawk at a fly  
Than this decision. Ev'ry blow that falls  
Threats a brave life, each stroke laments  
The place whereon it falls, and sounds more like  
A bell than blade. I will stay here,  
It is enough my hearing shall be punish'd  
With what shall happen--'gainst the which there is  
No deafing--but to hear, not taint mine eye  
With dread sights it may shun. /

**PIRITHOUS**  
/ Sir, my good lord,  
Your sister will no further. /

**THESEUS**  
/ O, she must!  
She are the victor's meed, the price and garland  
To crown the question's title. /

**EMILIA**  
/ Pardon me,  
If I were there, I'd wink. /

**THESEUS**  
/ You must be there;  
This trial is as 'twere i' th' night, and you  
The only star to shine. /

**EMILIA**  
/ I am extinct,  
There is but envy in that light which shows  
The one the other. Darkness, which ever was  
The dam of Horror, who does stand accurs'd  
Of many mortal millions, may even now,  
By casting her black mantle over both,  
That neither could find other, get herself  
Some part of a good name, and many a murder  
Set off whereto she's guilty. /

**HIPPOLYTA**  
/ You must go.

**EMILIA**  
In faith, I will not. /

**THESEUS**  
/ Why, the knights must kindle  
Their valor at your eye. Know, of this war  
You are the treasure, and must needs be by  
To give the service pay. /

**EMILIA**  
/ Sir, pardon me,  
The title of a kingdom may be tried  
Out of itself. /

**THESEUS**  
/ Well, well then, at your pleasure.  
Those that remain with you could wish their office  
To any of their enemies. /

**HIPPOLYTA**  
/ Farewell, sister,  
I am like to know your husband 'fore yourself  
By some small start of time. He whom the gods  
Do of the two know best, I pray them he  
Be made your lot.

*Exeunt Theseus, Hippolyta, and Pirithous*

**EMILIA**  
Arcite is gently visag'd; yet his eye  
Is like an engine bent, or a sharp weapon  
In a soft sheath; mercy and manly courage  
Are bedfellows in his visage. Palamon  
Has a most menacing aspect, his brow  
Is grav'd, and seems to bury what it frowns on,  
Yet sometime 'tis not so, but alters to  
The quality of his thoughts; long time his eye  
Will dwell upon his object; melancholy  
Becomes him nobly. So does Arcite's mirth,  
But Palamon's sadness is a kind of mirth,  
So mingled as if mirth did make him sad,  
And sadness merry; those darker humors that  
Stick misbecomingly on others, on him  
Live in fair dwelling.

*Cornets. Trumpets sound as to a charge.*

Hark how yon spurs to spirit do incite  
The princes to their proof! Arcite may win me,  
And yet may Palamon wound Arcite to  
The spoiling of his figure. O, what pity  
Enough for such a chance? If I were by,  
I might do hurt, for they would glance their eyes  
Toward my seat, and in that motion might  
Omit a ward, or forfeit an offense,  
Which crav'd that very time. It is much better  
I am not there. O, better never born  
Than minister to such harm! /

*Cornets. A great cry and noise within, crying "A Palamon! "*

*Enter Servant.*

/ What is the chance?

**SERVANT**  
The cry's "A Palamon!"

**EMILIA**  
Then he has won. 'Twas ever likely:  
He look'd all grace and success, and he is  
Doubtless the prim'st of men. I prithee run  
And tell me how it goes.

*Shout and cornets. Crying "A Palamon!" within.*

**SERVANT**  
Still "Palamon!"

**EMILIA**  
Run and inquire. /

*Exit Servant.*

/ Poor servant, thou hast lost.  
Upon my right side still I wore thy picture,  
Palamon's on the left. Why so, I know not;  
I had no end in't else; chance would have it so.  
On the sinister side the heart lies; Palamon  
Had the best-boding chance. /

*Another cry, and shout within, and cornets.*

/ This burst of clamor  
Is sure th' end o' th' combat.

*Enter Servant.*

**SERVANT**  
They said that Palamon had Arcite's body  
Within an inch o' th' pyramid, that the cry  
Was general "A Palamon!"; but anon  
Th' assistants made a brave redemption, and  
The two bold titlers at this instant are  
Hand to hand at it. /

**EMILIA**  
/ Were they metamorphis'd  
Both into one--O why? There were no woman  
Worth so compos'd a man! Their single share,  
Their nobleness peculiar to them, gives  
The prejudice of disparity, value's shortness,  
To any lady breathing. /

*Cornets. Cry within, "Arcite, Arcite! "*

/ More exulting?  
"Palamon" still? /

**SERVANT**  
/ Nay, now the sound is "Arcite."

**EMILIA**  
I prithee lay attention to the cry;  
Set both thine ears to th' business. /

*Cornets. A great shout and cry, "Arcite! Victory! "*

**SERVANT**  
/ The cry is  
"Arcite!" and "victory!" Hark, "Arcite! Victory!"  
The combat's consummation is proclaim'd  
By the wind instruments. /

*Exit Servant*

**EMILIA**  
/ Half-sights saw  
That Arcite was no babe. God's lid, his richness  
And costliness of spirit look'd through him, it could  
No more be hid in him than fire in flax,  
Than humble banks can go to law with waters  
That drift-winds force to raging. I did think  
Good Palamon would miscarry, yet I knew not  
Why I did think so. Our reasons are not prophets  
When oft our fancies are. They are coming off.  
Alas, poor Palamon!

*Cornets.*

*Enter Theseus, Hippolyta, Pirithous, and Arcite as victor*

**THESEUS**  
Lo, where our sister is in expectation,  
Yet quaking and unsettled. Fairest Emily,  
The gods by their divine arbitrement  
Have given you this knight: he is a good one  
As ever struck at head. Give me your hands.  
Receive you her, you him, be plighted with  
A love that grows as you decay. /

**ARCITE**  
/ Emily,  
To buy you I have lost what's dearest to me  
Save what is bought, and yet I purchase cheaply,  
As I do rate your value. /

**THESEUS**  
/ O loved sister,  
He speaks now of as brave a knight as e'er  
Did spur a noble steed. Wear the girlond  
With joy that you have won.--For the subdu'd,  
Give them our present justice, since I know  
Their lives but pinch 'em. Let it here be done.  
The scene's not for our seeing, go we hence,  
Right joyful, with some sorrow.--Arm your prize,  
I know you will not loose her.--Hippolyta,  
I see one eye of yours conceives a tear,  
The which it will deliver. /

**EMILIA**  
/ Is this winning?  
O all you heavenly powers, where is your mercy?  
But that your wills have said it must be so,  
And charge me live to comfort this unfriended,  
This miserable prince, that cuts away  
A life more worthy from him than all women,  
I should and would die too. /

**HIPPOLYTA**  
/ Infinite pity  
That four such eyes should be so fix'd on one  
That two must needs be blind for't! /

**THESEUS**  
/ So it is.

*Flourish. Exeunt*

### SCENE V: A Place Near the Lists. A Block Prepared.

*A block ready. Enter Palamon and his Knights pinion'd, Jailer, and Executioner*

**PALAMON**  
There's many a man alive that hath outliv'd  
The love o' th' people, yea, i' th' self-same state  
Stands many a father with his child. Some comfort  
We have by so considering: we expire,  
And not without men's pity; to live still,  
Have their good wishes; we prevent  
The loathsome misery of age, beguile  
The gout and rheum, that in lag hours attend  
For grey approachers; we come towards the gods  
Young and unwapper'd, not halting under crimes  
Many and stale. That sure shall please the gods  
Sooner than such, to give us nectar with 'em,  
For we are more clear spirits. My dear kinsmen,  
Whose lives (for this poor comfort) are laid down,  
You have sold 'em too too cheap. /

**FIRST KNIGHT**  
/ What ending could be  
Of more content? O'er us the victors have  
Fortune, whose title is as momentary  
As to us death is certain. A grain of honor  
They not o'erweigh us. /

**SECOND KNIGHT**  
Let us bid farewell;  
And with our patience anger tott'ring Fortune,  
Who at her certain'st reels. /

**FIRST KNIGHT**  
/ Come! Who begins?

**PALAMON**  
Ev'n he that led you to this banquet shall  
Taste to you all. /

*\[To the Jailer]*  
/ Ah ha, my friend, my friend,  
Your gentle daughter gave me freedom once;  
You'll see't done now forever. Pray how does she?  
I heard she was not well; her kind of ill  
Gave me some sorrow. /

**JAILER**  
/ Sir, she's well restor'd,  
And to be married shortly. /

**PALAMON**  
/ By my short life,  
I am most glad on't. 'Tis the latest thing  
I shall be glad of, prithee tell her so.  
Commend me to her, and to piece her portion  
Tender her this. /

*Gives purse.*

**FIRST KNIGHT**  
/ Nay, let's be offerers all.

**SECOND KNIGHT**  
Is it a maid? /

**PALAMON**  
/ Verily I think so,  
A right good creature, more to me deserving  
Than I can quite or speak of. /

**BOTH KNIGHTS**  
/ Commend us to her.

*They give their purses.*

**JAILER**  
The gods requite you all, and make her thankful!

**PALAMON**  
Adieu; and let my life be now as short  
As my leave-taking.

*Lies on the block.*

*A great noise within crying "Run! Save! Hold! "*

*Enter in haste a Messenger.*

**MESSENGER**  
/ Hold, hold! O, hold, hold, hold!

*Enter Pirithous in haste.*

**PIRITHOUS**  
Hold ho! It is a cursed haste you made  
If you have done so quickly. Noble Palamon,  
The gods will show their glory in a life  
That thou art yet to lead. /

**PALAMON**  
/ Can that be, when  
Venus I have said is false? How do things fare?

**PIRITHOUS**  
Arise, great sir, and give the tidings ear

*Palamon rises.*

That are most dearly sweet and bitter. /

**PALAMON**  
/ What  
Hath wak'd us from our dream? /

**PIRITHOUS**  
/ List then: your cousin,  
Mounted upon a steed that Emily  
Did first bestow on him--on this horse is Arcite  
Trotting the stones of Athens, which the calkins  
Did rather tell than trample; for the horse  
Would make his length a mile, if't pleas'd his rider  
To put pride in him. As he thus went counting  
The flinty pavement, dancing as 'twere to th' music  
His own hoofs made (for as they say from iron  
Came music's origin), what envious flint,  
Cold as old Saturn, and like him possess'd  
With fire malevolent, darted a spark,  
Or what fierce sulphur else, to this end made,  
I comment not--the hot horse, hot as fire,  
Took toy at this, and fell to what disorder  
His power could give his will, bounds, comes on end,  
Disroots his rider whence he grew, but that  
He kept him 'tween his legs, on his hind hoofs  
On end he stands,  
That Arcite's legs, being higher than his head,  
Seem'd with strange art to hang. His victor's wreath  
Even then fell off his head; and presently  
Backward the jade comes o'er, and his full poise  
Becomes the rider's load. Yet is he living,  
But such a vessel 'tis that floats but for  
The surge that next approaches. He much desires  
To have some speech with you. Lo he appears.

*Enter Theseus, Hippolyta, Emilia, Arcite in a chair.*

**PALAMON**  
O miserable end of our alliance!  
The gods are mighty, Arcite. If thy heart,  
Thy worthy, manly heart, be yet unbroken,  
Give me thy last words; I am Palamon,  
One that yet loves thee dying. /

**ARCITE**  
/ Take Emilia,  
And with her all the world's joy. Reach thy hand;  
Farewell. I have told my last hour; I was false,  
Yet never treacherous. Forgive me, cousin.  
One kiss from fair Emilia.--'Tis done.  
Take her. I die. /  
*\[Dies.]*

**PALAMON**  
/ Thy brave soul seek Elysium!

**EMILIA**  
I'll close thine eyes, prince; blessed souls be with thee!  
Thou art a right good man, and while I live,  
This day I give to tears. /

**PALAMON**  
/ And I to honor.

*Arcite is carried out.*

**PALAMON**  
O cousin,  
That we should things desire which do cost us  
The loss of our desire! That nought could buy  
Dear love but loss of dear love! /

**THESEUS**  
/ Never fortune  
Did play a subtler game. The conquer'd triumphs,  
The victor has the loss; yet in the passage  
The gods have been most equal. Palamon,  
Your kinsman hath confess'd the right o' th' lady  
Did lie in you, for you first saw her, and  
Even then proclaim'd your fancy. He restor'd her  
As your stol'n jewel, and desir'd your spirit  
To send him hence forgiven. The gods my justice  
Take from my hand, and they themselves become  
The executioners. Lead your lady off;  
And call your lovers from the stage of death,  
Whom I adopt my friends. A day or two  
Let us look sadly, and give grace unto  
The funeral of Arcite, in whose end  
The visages of bridegrooms we'll put on  
And smile with Palamon; for whom an hour,  
But one hour since, I was as dearly sorry  
As glad of Arcite; and am now as glad  
As for him sorry. O you heavenly charmers,  
What things you make of us! For what we lack  
We laugh, for what we have are sorry, still  
Are children in some kind. Let us be thankful  
For that which is, and with you leave dispute  
That are above our question. Let's go off,  
And bear us like the time.

*Flourish. Exeunt.*

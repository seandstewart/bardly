# Hamlet - 11 Players

## ACT I

### SCENE I. Elsinore. A platform before the castle.

*FRANCISCO at his post. Enter to him BERNARDO*

**BERNARDO**  
Who's there?

**FRANCISCO**  
Nay, answer me: stand, and unfold yourself.

**BERNARDO**  
Long live the king! /

**FRANCISCO**  
/ Bernardo? /

**BERNARDO**  
/ He.

**FRANCISCO**  
You come most carefully upon your hour.

**BERNARDO**  
'Tis now struck twelve; get thee to bed, Francisco.

**FRANCISCO**  
For this relief much thanks: 'tis bitter cold,  
And I am sick at heart.

**BERNARDO**  
Have you had quiet guard?

**FRANCISCO**  
Not a mouse stirring. /

**BERNARDO**  
/ Well, good night.  
If you do meet Horatio and Marcellus,  
The rivals of my watch, bid them make haste.

**FRANCISCO**  
I think I hear them. /

*Enter HORATIO and MARCELLUS*

**MARCELLUS**  
/ O, farewell, honest soldier:  
Who hath relieved you? /

**FRANCISCO**  
/ Bernardo has my place.  
Give you good night. /

*Exit*

**MARCELLUS**  
/ Holla! Bernardo!

**BERNARDO**  
What, is Horatio there? /

**HORATIO**  
/ A piece of him.

**MARCELLUS**  
What, has this thing appear'd again tonight?

**BERNARDO**  
I have seen nothing.

**MARCELLUS**  
Horatio says 'tis but our fantasy,  
Therefore I have entreated him along  
With us to watch the minutes of this night;

**BERNARDO**  
And let us once again assail your ears,  
What we have two nights seen.  
When yond same star that's westward from the pole  
Had made his course to illume that part of heaven

*Enter Ghost*

**MARCELLUS**  
Peace, break thee off; look, where it comes again!

**BERNARDO**  
Looks it not like the king? mark it, Horatio.

**HORATIO**  
Most like: it harrows me with fear and wonder.  
What art thou that usurp'st this time of night,  
Together with that fair and warlike form  
In which the majesty of buried Denmark  
Did sometimes march? by heaven I charge thee, speak!

**MARCELLUS**  
It is offended. /

**BERNARDO**  
/ See, it stalks away!

**HORATIO**  
Stay! speak, speak! I charge thee, speak!

*Exit Ghost*

**MARCELLUS**  
'Tis gone, and will not answer.

**BERNARDO**  
How now, Horatio! you tremble and look pale:  
Is not this something more than fantasy?

**MARCELLUS**  
Is it not like the king? /

**HORATIO**  
/ As thou art to thyself:  
Such was the very armor he had on  
When he the ambitious Norway combated;  
'Tis strange.  
This bodes some strange eruption to our state.

**MARCELLUS**  
Good now, sit down, and tell me, he that knows,  
Why this same strict and most observant watch  
So nightly toils the subject of the land,  
What might be toward, that this sweaty haste  
Doth make the night joint-laborer with the day:  
Who is't that can inform me? /

**HORATIO**  
/ That can I;  
At least, the whisper goes so. Our last king,  
Was, as you know, by Fortinbras of Norway,  
Dared to the combat; in which our valiant Hamlet  
Did slay this Fortinbras; who by a seal'd compact,  
Did forfeit, with his life, all those his lands  
Which he stood seized of, to the conqueror:  
Against the which, a moiety competent  
Was gaged by our king; which had return'd  
To the inheritance of Fortinbras,  
Had he been vanquisher; Now, sir, young Fortinbras,  
Shark'd up a list of lawless resolutes,  
For food and diet, to some enterprise  
That hath a stomach in't; which is no other  
But to recover of us, by strong hand  
And terms compulsatory, those foresaid lands  
So by his father lost: and this, I take it,  
The source of this our watch and the chief head  
Of this post-haste and romage in the land.

**BERNARDO**  
I think it be no other but e'en so:  
Well may it sort that this portentous figure  
Comes armed through our watch; so like the king  
That was and is the question of these wars.

**HORATIO**  
But soft, behold! lo, where it comes again!

*Re-enter Ghost*

I'll cross it, though it blast me. Stay, illusion!  
If there be any good thing to be done,  
That may to thee do ease and grace to me,  
Speak to me:

*Cock crows*

Or if thou hast uphoarded in thy life  
Extorted treasure in the womb of earth,  
For which, they say, you spirits oft walk in death,  
Speak of it: stay, and speak! Stop it, Marcellus.

**MARCELLUS**  
Shall I strike at it with my partisan?

**HORATIO**  
Do, if it will not stand. /

**BERNARDO**  
/ 'Tis here! /

**HORATIO**  
/ 'Tis here! /

**MARCELLUS**  
/ 'Tis gone!

*Exit Ghost*

We do it wrong, being so majestical,  
To offer it the show of violence;  
For it is, as the air, invulnerable,  
And our vain blows malicious mockery.

**BERNARDO**  
It was about to speak, when the cock crew.

**HORATIO**  
And then it started like a guilty thing  
Upon a fearful summons. I have heard,  
The cock, that is the trumpet to the morn,  
Awake the god of day; and, at his warning,  
The extravagant and erring spirit hies  
To his confine: and of the truth herein  
This present object made probation.  
But, look, the morn, in russet mantle clad,  
Walks o'er the dew of yon high eastward hill:  
Break we our watch up; and by my advice,  
Let us impart what we have seen tonight  
Unto young Hamlet; for, upon my life,  
This spirit, dumb to us, will speak to him.

**MARCELLUS**  
Let's do't, I pray; and I this morning know  
Where we shall find him most conveniently.

*Exeunt*

### SCENE II. A room of state in the castle.

*Enter KING CLAUDIUS, QUEEN GERTRUDE, HAMLET, POLONIUS, LAERTES, and
VOLTIMAND*

**KING CLAUDIUS**  
Though yet of Hamlet our dear brother's death  
The memory be green, and that it us befitted  
To bear our hearts in grief and our whole kingdom  
To be contracted in one brow of woe,  
Together with remembrance of ourselves.  
Therefore our sometime sister, now our queen,  
Have we, as 'twere with a defeated joy,--  
With mirth in funeral and with dirge in marriage,  
In equal scale weighing delight and dole,--  
Taken to wife: nor have we herein barr'd  
Your better wisdoms, which have freely gone  
With this affair along. For all, our thanks.  
Now follows, that you know, young Fortinbras,  
Holding a weak supposal of our worth,  
Or thinking by our late dear brother's death  
Our state to be disjoint and out of frame,  
He hath not fail'd to pester us with message,  
Importing the surrender of those lands  
Lost by his father, with all bonds of law,  
To our most valiant brother. So much for him.  
Now for ourself and for this time of meeting:  
Thus much the business is: we have here writ  
To Norway, uncle of young Fortinbras, to suppress  
His further gait herein; in that the levies,  
The lists and full proportions, are all made  
Out of his subject: and we here dispatch  
You, good friend Voltimand, indeed to be  
The bearer of this greeting to old Norway;  
Farewell, and let your haste commend your duty.

**VOLTIMAND**  
In that and all things will I show my duty.

**KING CLAUDIUS**  
We doubt it nothing: heartily farewell.

*Exeunt VOLTIMAND*

And now, Laertes, what's the news with you?  
You cannot speak of reason to the Dane,  
And loose your voice: what wouldst thou beg, Laertes?

**LAERTES**  
Your leave and favor to return to France;  
From whence though willingly I came to Denmark,  
To show my duty in your coronation,  
Yet now, I must confess, that duty done,  
My thoughts and wishes bend again toward France  
And bow them to your gracious leave and pardon.

**KING CLAUDIUS**  
Have you your father's leave? What says Polonius?

**LORD POLONIUS**  
He hath, my lord, wrung from me my slow leave  
By laborsome petition, and at last  
Upon his will I seal'd my hard consent.

**KING CLAUDIUS**  
Take thy fair hour, Laertes; time be thine,  
And thy best graces spend it at thy will!  
But now, my cousin Hamlet, and my son,--

**HAMLET**  
*\[Aside]*  
A little more than kin, and less than kind.

**KING CLAUDIUS**  
How is it that the clouds still hang on you?

**HAMLET**  
Not so, my lord; I am too much i' the sun.

**QUEEN GERTRUDE**  
Good Hamlet, cast thy nighted color off,  
And let thine eye look like a friend on Denmark.  
Do not for ever with thy vailed lids  
Seek for thy noble father in the dust:  
Thou know'st 'tis common; all that lives must die,  
Passing through nature to eternity.  
Why seems it so particular with thee?

**HAMLET**  
Seems, madam! nay it is; I know not 'seems.'  
'Tis not alone my inky cloak, good mother,  
Nor customary suits of solemn black,  
No, nor the fruitful river in the eye,  
Together with all forms, moods, shapes of grief,  
That can denote me truly: these indeed seem,  
For they are actions that a man might play:  
But I have that within which passeth show;  
These but the trappings and the suits of woe.

**KING CLAUDIUS**  
But, you must know, your father lost a father;  
That father lost, lost his, and the survivor bound  
In filial obligation for some term  
To do obsequious sorrow: but to persever  
In obstinate condolement is a course  
Of impious stubbornness; 'tis unmanly grief;  
You are the most immediate to our throne;  
And with no less nobility of love  
Than that which dearest father bears his son,  
Do I impart toward you. For your intent  
In going back to school in Wittenberg,  
It is most retrograde to our desire:  
And we beseech you, bend you to remain  
Here, in the cheer and comfort of our eye,  
Our chiefest courtier, cousin, and our son.

**QUEEN GERTRUDE**  
Let not thy mother lose her prayers, Hamlet:  
I pray thee, stay with us; go not to Wittenberg.

**HAMLET**  
I shall in all my best obey you, madam.

**KING CLAUDIUS**  
Why, 'tis a loving and a fair reply:  
Be as ourself in Denmark. Madam, come;  
This gentle and unforced accord of Hamlet  
Sits smiling to my heart: Come away.

*Exeunt all but HAMLET*

**HAMLET**  
O, that this too too solid flesh would melt  
Thaw and resolve itself into a dew!  
Or that the Everlasting had not fix'd  
His canon 'gainst self-slaughter! O God! God!  
How weary, stale, flat and unprofitable,  
Seem to me all the uses of this world!  
Fie on't! ah fie! 'tis an unweeded garden,  
That grows to seed; things rank and gross in nature  
Possess it merely. That it should come to this!  
But two months dead: nay, not so much, not two:  
So excellent a king; that was, to this,  
Hyperion to a satyr; so loving to my mother  
That he might not beteem the winds of heaven  
Visit her face too roughly. Heaven and earth!  
Must I remember? and yet, within a month--  
Let me not think on't-Frailty, thy name is woman!--  
A little month, or ere those shoes were old  
With which she follow'd my poor father's body,  
Ere yet the salt of most unrighteous tears  
Had left the flushing in her galled eyes,  
She married. O, most wicked speed, to post  
With such dexterity to incestuous sheets!  
It is not nor it cannot come to good:  
But break, my heart; for I must hold my tongue.

*Enter HORATIO, MARCELLUS, and BERNARDO*

**HORATIO**  
Hail to your lordship!

**HAMLET**  
I am glad to see you well:  
Horatio,--or I do forget myself.

**HORATIO**  
The same, my lord, and your poor servant ever.

**HAMLET**  
I am very glad to see you. Good even, sir.  
But what, in faith, make you from Wittenberg?

**HORATIO**  
My lord, I came to see your father's funeral.

**HAMLET**  
I pray thee, do not mock me, fellow-student;  
I think it was to see my mother's wedding.

**HORATIO**  
Indeed, my lord, it follow'd hard upon.

**HAMLET**  
Thrift, thrift, Horatio! the funeral baked meats  
Did coldly furnish forth the marriage tables.  
Would I had met my dearest foe in heaven  
Or ever I had seen that day, Horatio!  
My father!--methinks I see my father.

**HORATIO**  
Where, my lord? /

**HAMLET**  
/ In my mind's eye, Horatio.

**HORATIO**  
I saw him once; he was a goodly king.

**HAMLET**  
He was a man, take him for all in all,  
I shall not look upon his like again.

**HORATIO**  
My lord, I think I saw him yesternight.

**HAMLET**  
Saw? who? /

**HORATIO**  
/ My lord, the king your father.

**HAMLET**  
The king my father!

**HORATIO**  
Two nights together had these gentlemen,  
Marcellus and Bernardo, on their watch,  
Been thus encounter'd. A figure like your father,  
Appears before them, and with solemn march  
Goes slow and stately by them: thrice he walk'd  
By their oppress'd and fear-surprised eyes,  
Within his truncheon's length; whilst they  
Stand dumb and speak not to him. This to me  
In dreadful secrecy impart they did;  
And I with them the third night kept the watch;  
The apparition comes: I knew your father;  
These hands are not more like. /

**HAMLET**  
/ But where was this?

**MARCELLUS**  
My lord, upon the platform where we watch'd.

**HAMLET**  
Did you not speak to it? /

**HORATIO**  
/ My lord, I did;  
But answer made it none: yet once methought  
It lifted up its head and did address  
Itself to motion, like as it would speak;  
But even then the morning cock crew loud,  
And vanish'd from our sight. /

**HAMLET**  
/ 'Tis very strange.

**HORATIO**  
As I do live, my honour'd lord, 'tis true;  
And we did think it writ down in our duty  
To let you know of it.

**HAMLET**  
Indeed, indeed, sirs, but this troubles me.  
Hold you the watch to-night? /

**MARCELLUS & BERNARDO**  
/ We do, my lord.

**HAMLET**  
Arm'd, say you? /

**MARCELLUS & BERNARDO**  
/ Arm'd, my lord. /

**HAMLET**  
/ From top to toe?

**MARCELLUS & BERNARDO**  
My lord, from head to foot. /

**HAMLET**  
/ Then saw you not his face?

**HORATIO**  
O, yes, my lord; he wore his beaver up.

**HAMLET**  
What, look'd he frowningly?

**HORATIO**  
A countenance more in sorrow than in anger.

**HAMLET**  
Pale or red? /

**HORATIO**  
/ Nay, very pale. /

**HAMLET**  
/ And fix'd his eyes upon you?

**HORATIO**  
Most constantly. /

**HAMLET**  
/ I would I had been there.

**HORATIO**  
It would have much amazed you.

**HAMLET**  
Very like, very like. Stay'd it long?

**HORATIO**  
While one with moderate haste might tell a hundred.

**MARCELLUS & BERNARDO**  
Longer, longer. /

**HORATIO**  
/ Not when I saw't. /

**HAMLET**  
/ His beard was grizzled--no?

**HORATIO**  
It was, as I have seen it in his life,  
A sable silver'd. /

**HAMLET**  
/ I will watch tonight;  
Perchance 'twill walk again. /

**HORATIO**  
/ I warrant it will.

**HAMLET**  
If it assume my noble father's person,  
I'll speak to it, though hell itself should gape  
And bid me hold my peace. I pray you all,  
If you have hitherto conceal'd this sight,  
And whatsoever else shall hap tonight,  
Give it an understanding, but no tongue:  
I will requite your loves. So, fare you well:  
Upon the platform, 'twixt eleven and twelve,  
I'll visit you. /

**All**  
/ Our duty to your honour.

**HAMLET**  
Your loves, as mine to you: farewell.

*Exeunt all but HAMLET*

My father's spirit in arms! all is not well;  
I doubt some foul play: would the night were come!  
Till then sit still, my soul: foul deeds will rise,  
Though all the earth o'erwhelm them, to men's eyes.

*Exit*

### SCENE III. A room in Polonius' house.

*Enter LAERTES and OPHELIA*

**LAERTES**  
My necessaries are embark'd: farewell:  
And, sister, as the winds give benefit  
And convoy is assistant, do not sleep,  
But let me hear from you. /

**OPHELIA**  
/ Do you doubt that?

**LAERTES**  
For Hamlet and the trifling of his favor,  
Hold it a fashion and a toy in blood,  
A violet in the youth of primy nature,  
The perfume and suppliance of a minute;  
No more. /

**OPHELIA**  
/ No more but so? /

**LAERTES**  
/ Think it no more;  
His greatness weigh'd, his will is not his own;  
For he himself is subject to his birth:  
And therefore must his choice be circumscribed  
Unto the voice and yielding of that body  
Whereof he is the head. Then if he says he loves you,  
It fits your wisdom so far to believe it  
May give his saying deed; which is no further  
Than the main voice of Denmark goes withal.  
Then weigh what loss your honour may sustain,  
If with too credent ear you list his songs,  
Or lose your heart, or your chaste treasure open  
To his unmaster'd importunity.

**OPHELIA**  
I shall the effect of this good lesson keep.

**LAERTES**  
I stay too long: but here my father comes.

*Enter POLONIUS*

A double blessing is a double grace,  
Occasion smiles upon a second leave.

**LORD POLONIUS**  
The wind sits in the shoulder of your sail,  
And you are stay'd for. There; my blessing with thee!  
And these few precepts in thy memory  
See thou character. Give thy thoughts no tongue,  
Nor any unproportioned thought his act.  
Be thou familiar, but by no means vulgar.  
But do not dull thy palm with entertainment  
Of each new-hatch'd, unfledged comrade. Beware  
Of entrance to a quarrel, but being in,  
Bear't that the opposed may beware of thee.  
Give every man thy ear, but few thy voice;  
Neither a borrower nor a lender be;  
For loan oft loses both itself and friend,  
And borrowing dulls the edge of husbandry.  
This above all: to thine ownself be true,  
And it must follow, as the night the day,  
Thou canst not then be false to any man.

**LAERTES**  
Most humbly do I take my leave, my lord.  
Farewell, Ophelia; and remember well  
What I have said to you. /

**OPHELIA**  
/ 'Tis in my memory lock'd,  
And you yourself shall keep the key of it.

*Exit*

**LORD POLONIUS**  
What is't, Ophelia, he hath said to you?

**OPHELIA**  
So please you, something touching the Lord Hamlet.

**LORD POLONIUS**  
Marry, well bethought:  
'Tis told me, he hath very oft of late  
Given private time to you; and you yourself  
Have of your audience been most free and bounteous:  
What is between you? give me up the truth.

**OPHELIA**  
He hath, my lord, of late made many tenders  
Of his affection to me.

**LORD POLONIUS**  
Affection! pooh! you speak like a green girl,  
Do you believe his tenders, as you call them?

**OPHELIA**  
My lord, he hath importuned me with love  
In honourable fashion.  
And hath given countenance to his speech, my lord,  
With almost all the holy vows of heaven.

**LORD POLONIUS**  
Ay, springes to catch woodcocks. I do know,  
When the blood burns, how prodigal the soul  
Lends the tongue vows: these blazes, daughter,  
You must not take for fire. From this time  
Be somewhat scanter of your maiden presence;  
Believe so much in him, that he is young  
And with a larger tether may he walk  
Than may be given you: in few, Ophelia,  
Do not believe his vows; for they are brokers,  
Mere implorators of unholy suits,  
I would not, in plain terms, from this time forth,  
Have you so slander any moment leisure,  
As to give words or talk with the Lord Hamlet.

**OPHELIA**  
I shall obey, my lord.

*Exeunt*

### SCENE IV. The platform.

*Enter HAMLET, HORATIO, and MARCELLUS*

**HAMLET**  
The air bites shrewdly; it is very cold.

**HORATIO**  
It is a nipping and an eager air.

**HAMLET**  
What hour now? /

**HORATIO**  
/ I think it lacks of twelve.

**HAMLET**  
No, it is struck. /

**HORATIO**  
/ Look, my lord, it comes!

*Enter Ghost*

**HAMLET**  
Angels and ministers of grace defend us!  
Be thou a spirit of health or goblin damn'd,  
Bring with thee airs from heaven or blasts from hell,  
Thou comest in such a questionable shape  
That I will speak to thee: I'll call thee Hamlet,  
King, father, royal Dane: O, answer me!  
Why thou, dead corse, again in complete steel  
Revisit'st thus the glimpses of the moon,  
So horridly to shake our disposition  
With thoughts beyond the reaches of our souls?  
Say, why is this? wherefore? what should we do?

*Ghost beckons HAMLET*

**HORATIO**  
It beckons you to go away with it,  
As if it some impartment did desire  
To you alone. /

**MARCELLUS**  
/ But do not go with it.

**HAMLET**  
Why, what should be the fear?

**HORATIO**  
What if it tempt you toward the flood, my lord,  
Or to the dreadful summit of the cliff  
And there assume some other horrible form,  
Which might deprive your sovereignty of reason  
And draw you into madness? Think of it.

**HAMLET**  
Go on; I'll follow thee.

**MARCELLUS**  
You shall not go, my lord. /

**HAMLET**  
/ Hold off your hands.

**HORATIO**  
Be ruled; you shall not go. /

**HAMLET**  
/ My fate cries out!  
Still am I call'd. Unhand me, gentlemen.  
I say, away! Go on; I'll follow thee.

*Exeunt Ghost and HAMLET*

**HORATIO**  
He waxes desperate with imagination.

**MARCELLUS**  
Let's follow; 'tis not fit thus to obey him.

**HORATIO**  
Have after. To what issue will this come?

**MARCELLUS**  
Something is rotten in the state of Denmark.

*Exeunt*

### SCENE V. Another part of the platform.

*Enter GHOST and HAMLET*

**HAMLET**  
Where wilt thou lead me? speak; I'll go no further.

**Ghost**  
So art thou to revenge, when thou shalt hear. /

**HAMLET**  
/ What?

**Ghost**  
I am thy father's spirit,  
Doom'd for a certain term to walk the night,  
And for the day confined to fast in fires,  
Till the foul crimes done in my days of nature  
Are burnt and purged away. But that I am forbid  
To tell the secrets of my prison-house,  
I could a tale unfold whose lightest word  
Would harrow up thy soul, freeze thy young blood.  
If thou didst ever thy dear father love--

**HAMLET**  
O God!

**Ghost**  
Revenge his foul and most unnatural murder.

**HAMLET**  
Murder!

**Ghost**  
Murder most foul, as in the best it is;  
But this most foul, strange and unnatural.  
'Tis given out that, sleeping in my orchard,  
A serpent stung me; so the whole ear of Denmark  
Is by a forged process of my death  
Rankly abused: but know, thou noble youth,  
The serpent that did sting thy father's life  
Now wears his crown.

**HAMLET**  
O my prophetic soul! My uncle!

**Ghost**  
Ay, that incestuous, that adulterate beast,  
With witchcraft of his wit, with traitorous gifts,--  
O wicked wit and gifts, that have the power  
So to seduce!--won to his shameful lust  
The will of my most seeming-virtuous queen:  
Brief let me be. Sleeping within my orchard,  
Upon my secure hour thy uncle stole,  
With juice of cursed hebenon in a vial,  
And in the porches of my ears did pour  
The leperous distilment; whose effect  
Holds such an enmity with blood of man  
That swift as quicksilver it courses through  
The natural gates and alleys of the body,  
And with a sudden vigor doth posset  
The thin and wholesome blood: so did it mine;  
Thus was I, sleeping, by a brother's hand  
Of life, of crown, of queen, at once dispatch'd:  
Cut off even in the blossoms of my sin,  
No reckoning made, but sent to my account  
With all my imperfections on my head:  
If thou hast nature in thee, bear it not;  
Let not the royal bed of Denmark be  
A couch for luxury and damned incest.  
But, howsoever thou pursuest this act,  
Taint not thy mind, nor let thy soul contrive  
Against thy mother aught: leave her to heaven  
Adieu, adieu! Hamlet, remember me.

*Exit*

**HAMLET**  
O all you host of heaven! O earth! what else?  
And shall I couple hell? O, fie! Hold, hold, my heart;  
And you, my sinews, grow not instant old,  
But bear me stiffly up. Remember thee!  
Yea, from the table of my memory  
I'll wipe away all trivial fond records,  
And thy commandment all alone shall live  
Within the book and volume of my brain,  
O most pernicious woman!  
O villain, villain, smiling, damned villain!

*\[Writing]*  
So, uncle, there you are. Now to my word;
It is 'Adieu, adieu! remember me.'  
I have sworn 't.

**MARCELLUS & HORATIO**  
*\[Within]*  
My lord, my lord,--

**HAMLET**  
Hillo, ho, ho, boy! come, bird, come.

*Enter HORATIO and MARCELLUS*

**MARCELLUS**  
How is't, my noble lord? /

**HORATIO**  
/ What news, my lord?

**HAMLET**  
There's ne'er a villain dwelling in all Denmark  
But he's an arrant knave.

**HORATIO**  
There needs no ghost, my lord, come from the grave  
To tell us this. /

**HAMLET**  
/ Why, right; you are i' the right;  
And so, without more circumstance at all,  
I hold it fit that we shake hands and part:  
You, as your business and desire shall point you;  
For every man has business and desire,  
Such as it is; and for mine own poor part,  
Look you, I'll go pray.

**HORATIO**  
These are but wild and whirling words, my lord.

**HAMLET**  
I'm sorry they offend you, heartily;  
It is an honest ghost, that let me tell you:  
For your desire to know what is between us,  
O'ermaster 't as you may. And now, good friends,  
As you are friends, scholars and soldiers,  
Give me one poor request. /

**HORATIO**  
/ What is't, my lord? we will.

**HAMLET**  
Never make known what you have seen tonight.  
Nay, but swear't. /

**MARCELLUS & HORATIO**  
/ We have sworn, my lord.

**Ghost**  
*\[Beneath]*  
Swear.

**HORATIO**  
Propose the oath, my lord.

**HAMLET**  
Never to speak of this that you have seen,  
Swear by my sword. /

**Ghost**  
*\[Beneath]*  
/ Swear. /

**HAMLET**  
/ Come hither, gentlemen,  
And lay your hands again upon my sword:  
Never to speak of this that you have heard,  
Swear by my sword. /

**Ghost**  
*\[Beneath]*  
/ Swear.

**HAMLET**  
Well said, old mole! canst work i' the earth so fast?  
A worthy pioneer! Once more remove, good friends.

**HORATIO**  
O day and night, but this is wondrous strange!

**Ghost**  
*\[Beneath]*  
Swear.

**HAMLET**  
Rest, rest, perturbed spirit! /

*They swear*

/ So, gentlemen,  
With all my love I do commend me to you:  
And what so poor a man as Hamlet is  
May do, to express his love and friending to you,  
God willing, shall not lack. Let us go in together;  
The time is out of joint: O cursed spite,  
That ever I was born to set it right!

*Exeunt*

## ACT II

### SCENE I. A room in POLONIUS' house.

*Enter POLONIUS and REYNALDO*

**LORD POLONIUS**  
Give him this money and these notes, Reynaldo.

**REYNALDO**  
I will, my lord.

**LORD POLONIUS**  
You shall do marvellous wisely, good Reynaldo,  
Before you visit him, to make inquire  
Of his behavior. And there put on him  
What forgeries you please; marry, none so rank  
As may dishonour him; take heed of that;  
But, sir, such wanton, wild and usual slips  
As are companions noted and most known  
To youth and liberty. /

**REYNALDO**  
/ As gaming, my lord.

**LORD POLONIUS**  
Ay, or drinking, fencing, swearing, quarrelling,  
Drabbing: you may go so far. /

**REYNALDO**  
/ But, my good lord,--

**LORD POLONIUS**  
Wherefore should you do this? /

**REYNALDO**  
/ Ay, my lord,  
I would know that. /

**LORD POLONIUS**  
/ Marry, sir, here's my drift;  
And I believe, it is a fetch of wit:  
You laying these slight sullies on my son,  
As 'twere a thing a little soil'd i' the working,  
Mark you,  
Your party in converse, him you would sound,  
Having ever seen in the prenominate crimes  
The youth you breathe of guilty, be assured  
He closes with you in this consequence;  
'Good sir,' or so, or 'friend,' or 'gentleman,'  
I saw him yesterday, or t’ other day,  
There was a’ gaming; there o’ertook in’s rouse;  
There falling out at tennis:’ or perchance,  
‘I saw him enter such a house of sale,’  
Videlicet, a brothel, or so forth.  
See you now;  
Your bait of falsehood takes this carp of truth:  
And thus do we of wisdom and of reach,  
With windlasses and with assays of bias,  
By indirections find directions out:  
So by my former lecture and advice,  
Shall you my son. You have me, have you not?

**REYNALDO**  
My lord, I have.

**LORD POLONIUS**  
God be wi' you; fare you well.

*Exit REYNALDO*

*Enter OPHELIA*

How now, Ophelia! what's the matter?

**OPHELIA**  
O, my lord, my lord, I have been so affrighted!  
My lord, as I was sewing in my closet,  
Lord Hamlet, with his doublet all unbraced;  
No hat upon his head; his stockings foul'd,  
And with a look so piteous in purport  
As if he had been loosed out of hell  
To speak of horrors,-he comes before me.

**LORD POLONIUS**  
Mad for thy love? /

**OPHELIA**  
/ My lord, I do not know;  
He took me by the wrist and held me hard;  
Then goes he to the length of all his arm;  
And, with his other hand thus o'er his brow,  
He falls to such perusal of my face  
As he would draw it. Long stay'd he so;  
At last, a little shaking of mine arm  
And thrice his head thus waving up and down,  
He raised a sigh so piteous and profound  
As it did seem to shatter all his bulk  
And end his being: that done, he lets me go:  
And, with his head over his shoulder turn'd,  
He seem'd to find his way without his eyes;  
For out o' doors he went without their helps,  
And, to the last, bended their light on me.

**LORD POLONIUS**  
Come, go with me: I will go seek the king.  
This is the very ecstasy of love,  
And leads the will to desperate undertakings  
That does afflict our natures. I am sorry.  
What, have you given him any hard words of late?

**OPHELIA**  
No, my good lord, but, as you did command,  
I did repel his fetters and denied  
His access to me. /

**LORD POLONIUS**  
/ That hath made him mad.  
By heaven, it is as proper to our age  
To cast beyond ourselves in our opinions  
As it is common for the younger sort  
To lack discretion. Come, go we to the king:  
This must be known; which, being kept close, might move  
More grief to hide than hate to utter love.

*Exeunt*

### SCENE II. A room in the castle.

*Enter KING CLAUDIUS, QUEEN GERTRUDE, ROSENCRANTZ, and GUILDENSTERN*

**KING CLAUDIUS**  
Welcome, dear Rosencrantz and Guildenstern!  
The need we have to use you did provoke  
Our hasty sending. Something have you heard  
Of Hamlet's transformation; so call it,  
Sith nor the exterior nor the inward man  
Resembles that it was. I entreat you both,  
That, being of so young days brought up with him,  
That you vouchsafe your rest here in our court  
Some little time: so by your companies  
To draw him on to pleasures, and to gather,  
Whether aught, to us unknown, afflicts him thus,  
That, open'd, lies within our remedy.

**QUEEN GERTRUDE**  
Good gentlemen, he hath much talk'd of you;  
And sure I am two men there are not living  
To whom he more adheres. If it will please you  
To show us so much gentry and good will  
As to expend your time with us awhile,  
Your visitation shall receive such thanks  
As fits a king's remembrance. /

**ROSENCRANTZ**  
/ Both your majesties  
Might, by the sovereign power you have of us,  
Put your dread pleasures more into command  
Than to entreaty. /

**GUILDENSTERN**  
/ But we both obey,  
And here give up ourselves, in the full bent  
To lay our service freely at your feet,  
To be commanded.

**KING CLAUDIUS**  
Thanks, Rosencrantz and gentle Guildenstern.

**QUEEN GERTRUDE**  
Thanks, Guildenstern and gentle Rosencrantz.

*Exeunt ROSENCRANTZ, GUILDENSTERN*

*Enter POLONIUS*

**LORD POLONIUS**  
The ambassadors from Norway, my good lord,  
Are joyfully return'd.

**KING CLAUDIUS**  
Thou still hast been the father of good news.

**LORD POLONIUS**  
Have I, my lord? I assure my good liege,  
I hold my duty, as I hold my soul,  
And I do think, or else this brain of mine  
Hunts not the trail of policy so sure  
As it hath used to do, that I have found  
The very cause of Hamlet's lunacy.

**KING CLAUDIUS**  
O, speak of that; that do I long to hear.

**LORD POLONIUS**  
My liege, and madam, to expostulate  
What majesty should be, what duty is,  
Why day is day, night night, and time is time,  
Were nothing but to waste night, day and time.  
Therefore, since brevity is the soul of wit,  
I will be brief: your noble son is mad:  
Mad call I it; for, to define true madness,  
What is't but to be nothing else but mad?  
But let that go. /

**QUEEN GERTRUDE**  
/ More matter, with less art.

**LORD POLONIUS**  
That he is mad, 'tis true: 'tis true 'tis pity;  
And pity 'tis 'tis true: a foolish figure;  
But farewell it, for I will use no art.  
Mad let us grant him, then: and now remains  
That we find out the cause of this effect,  
Or rather say, the cause of this defect,  
For this effect defective comes by cause:  
Thus it remains, and the remainder thus. Perpend.  
I have a daughter--have while she is mine--  
Who, in her duty and obedience, mark,  
Hath given me this: now gather, and surmise.

*\[Reads]*  
'To the celestial and my soul's idol, the most  
beautified Ophelia,'--

That's an ill phrase, a vile phrase; 'beautified' is  
a vile phrase: but you shall hear. Thus:

*\[Reads]*  
'In her excellent white bosom, these, & c.'

**QUEEN GERTRUDE**  
Came this from Hamlet to her?

**LORD POLONIUS**  
Good madam, stay awhile; I will be faithful.

*\[Reads]*  
'O dear Ophelia, I am ill at these numbers;  
I have not art to reckon my groans: but that  
I love thee best, O most best, believe it. Adieu.  
'Thine evermore most dear lady, whilst  
this machine is to him, HAMLET.'

This, in obedience, hath my daughter shown me,

**KING CLAUDIUS**  
But how hath she received his love?

**LORD POLONIUS**  
As I perceived it, I must tell you that,  
Before my daughter told me-what might you,  
Or my dear majesty your queen here, think,  
If I had play'd the desk or table-book,  
Or look'd upon this love with idle sight;  
What might you think? No, I went round to work,  
And my young mistress thus I did bespeak:  
'Lord Hamlet is a prince, out of thy star;  
This must not be:' and then I precepts gave her,  
That she should lock herself from his resort,  
Which done, she took the fruits of my advice;  
And he, repulsed--a short tale to make--  
Fell into a sadness, then into a fast,  
Thence to a watch, thence into a weakness,  
Thence to a lightness, and, by this declension,  
Into the madness wherein now he raves,  
And all we mourn for. /

**KING CLAUDIUS**  
/ Do you think 'tis this?

**QUEEN GERTRUDE**  
It may be, very likely.

**LORD POLONIUS**  
*\[Pointing to his head and shoulder]*  
Take this from this, if this be otherwise:  
If circumstances lead me, I will find  
Where truth is hid, though it were hid indeed  
Within the center. /

**KING CLAUDIUS**  
/ How may we try it further?

**LORD POLONIUS**  
You know, sometimes he walks four hours together  
Here in the lobby. /

**QUEEN GERTRUDE**  
/ So he does indeed.

**LORD POLONIUS**  
At such a time I'll loose my daughter to him:  
Be you and I behind an arras then;  
Mark the encounter. /

**KING CLAUDIUS**  
/ We will try it.

**QUEEN GERTRUDE**  
But, look, where sadly the poor wretch comes reading.

**LORD POLONIUS**  
Away, I do beseech you, both away:  
I'll board him presently.

*Exeunt KING CLAUDIUS and QUEEN GERTRUDE*

*Enter HAMLET, reading*

Do you know me, my lord?

**HAMLET**  
Excellent well; you are a fishmonger.

**LORD POLONIUS**  
Not I, my lord.

**HAMLET**  
Then I would you were so honest a man.

**LORD POLONIUS**  
Honest, my lord!

**HAMLET**  
Ay, sir; to be honest, as this world goes, is to be  
one man picked out of ten thousand.

**LORD POLONIUS**  
That's very true, my lord.

**HAMLET**  
For if the sun breed maggots in a dead dog, being a  
god kissing carrion,--Have you a daughter?

**LORD POLONIUS**  
I have, my lord.

**HAMLET**  
Let her not walk i' the sun: conception is a  
blessing: but not as your daughter may conceive.

**LORD POLONIUS**  
What do you read, my lord?

**HAMLET**  
Words, words, words.

**LORD POLONIUS**  
What is the matter, my lord?

**HAMLET**  
Between who?

**LORD POLONIUS**  
I mean, the matter that you read, my lord.

**HAMLET**  
Slanders, sir: for the satirical rogue says here  
that old men have grey beards, that their faces are  
wrinkled, their eyes purging thick amber and  
plum-tree gum and that they have a plentiful lack of  
wit, together with most weak hams: all which, sir,  
though I most powerfully and potently believe, yet  
I hold it not honesty to have it thus set down, for  
yourself, sir, should be old as I am, if like a crab  
you could go backward.

**LORD POLONIUS**  
*\[Aside]*  
Though this be madness, yet there is method in't.

Will you walk out of the air, my lord?

**HAMLET**  
Into my grave.

**LORD POLONIUS**  
Indeed, that is out o' the air. My honourable  
lord, I will most humbly take my leave of you.

**HAMLET**  
You cannot, sir, take from me any thing that I will  
more willingly part withal: except my life, except  
my life, except my life.

*Enter ROSENCRANTZ & GUILDENSTERN*

**ROSENCRANTZ**  
*\[To POLONIUS]*  
God save you, sir!

*Exit POLONIUS*

**HAMLET**  
My excellent good friends! How dost thou,  
Guildenstern? Ah, Rosencrantz! Good lads, how do ye both?

**ROSENCRANTZ**  
As the indifferent children of the earth.

**GUILDENSTERN**  
Happy, in that we are not over-happy;  
On fortune's cap we are not the very button.

**HAMLET**  
Nor the soles of her shoe? /

**ROSENCRANTZ**  
/ Neither, my lord.

**HAMLET**  
Then you live about her waist, or in the middle of  
her favours?

**GUILDENSTERN**  
'Faith, her privates we.

**HAMLET**  
In the secret parts of fortune? O, most true; she  
is a strumpet. What's the news?

**ROSENCRANTZ**  
None, my lord, but that the world's grown honest.

**HAMLET**  
Then is doomsday near: but your news is not true.  
Let me question more in particular: what have you,  
my good friends, deserved at the hands of fortune,  
that she sends you to prison hither?

**GUILDENSTERN**  
Prison, my lord!

**HAMLET**  
Denmark's a prison.

**ROSENCRANTZ**  
Then is the world one.

**HAMLET**  
A goodly one; in which there are many confines,  
wards and dungeons, Denmark being one o' the worst.

**ROSENCRANTZ**  
We think not so, my lord.

**HAMLET**  
Why, then, 'tis none to you; for there is nothing  
either good or bad, but thinking makes it so: to me  
it is a prison.

**ROSENCRANTZ**  
Why then, your ambition makes it one; 'tis too  
narrow for your mind.

**HAMLET**  
O God, I could be bounded in a nut shell and count  
myself a king of infinite space, were it not that I  
have bad dreams.

**GUILDENSTERN**  
Which dreams indeed are ambition, for the very  
substance of the ambitious is merely the shadow of a dream.

**HAMLET**  
A dream itself is but a shadow.

**ROSENCRANTZ**  
Truly, and I hold ambition of so airy and light a  
quality that it is but a shadow's shadow.

**HAMLET**  
Then are our beggars bodies, and our monarchs and  
outstretched heroes the beggars' shadows. But, in the  
beaten way of friendship, what make you at Elsinore?

**ROSENCRANTZ**  
To visit you, my lord; no other occasion.

**HAMLET**  
I know the good king and queen have sent for you.

**ROSENCRANTZ**  
To what end, my lord?

**HAMLET**  
That you must teach me.

**GUILDENSTERN**  
My lord, we were sent for.

**HAMLET**  
I will tell you why; so shall my anticipation  
prevent your discovery, and your secrecy to the king  
and queen moult no feather. I have of late--but  
wherefore I know not--lost all my mirth, forgone all  
custom of exercises; and indeed it goes so heavily  
with my disposition that this goodly frame, the  
earth, seems to me a sterile promontory, this most  
excellent canopy, the air, look you, this brave  
o'erhanging firmament, this majestical roof fretted  
with golden fire, why, it appears no other thing to  
me than a foul and pestilent congregation of vapours.  
What a piece of work is a man! how noble in reason!  
how infinite in faculty! in form and moving how  
express and admirable! in action how like an angel!  
in apprehension how like a god! the beauty of the  
world! the paragon of animals! And yet, to me,  
what is this quintessence of dust? man delights not  
me: no, nor woman neither, though by your smiling  
you seem to say so.

**ROSENCRANTZ**  
My lord, there was no such stuff in my thoughts.

**HAMLET**  
Why did you laugh then, when I said 'man delights not me'?

**ROSENCRANTZ**  
To think, my lord, if you delight not in man, what  
lenten entertainment the players shall receive from  
you: we coted them on the way; and hither are they  
coming, to offer you service.

**HAMLET**  
What players are they?

**ROSENCRANTZ**  
Even those you were wont to take delight in, the  
tragedians of the city.

*Flourish of trumpets within*

**GUILDENSTERN**  
There are the players.

**HAMLET**  
Gentlemen, you are welcome to Elsinore. Your hands,  
come then. You are welcome: but my  
uncle-father and aunt-mother are deceived.

**GUILDENSTERN**  
In what, my dear lord?

**HAMLET**  
I am but mad north-north-west: when the wind is  
southerly I know a hawk from a handsaw.

*Enter POLONIUS*

**LORD POLONIUS**  
Well be with you, gentlemen!

**HAMLET**  
Hark you, Guildenstern; and you too: at each ear a  
hearer: that great baby you see there is not yet  
out of his swaddling-clouts.

**ROSENCRANTZ**  
Happily he's the second time come to them; for they  
say an old man is twice a child.

**LORD POLONIUS**  
My lord, I have news to tell you.  
The actors are come hither, my lord.

**HAMLET**  
Buz, buz!

**LORD POLONIUS**  
Upon mine honour,--

**HAMLET**  
Then came each actor on his ass,--

**LORD POLONIUS**  
The best actors in the world, either for tragedy,  
comedy, history, pastoral, pastoral-comical,  
historical-pastoral, tragical-historical, tragical--  
comical-historical-pastoral, scene individable, or  
poem unlimited: Seneca cannot be too heavy, nor  
Plautus too light. For the law of writ and the  
liberty, these are the only men.

**HAMLET**  
O Jephthah, judge of Israel, what a treasure hadst thou!

**LORD POLONIUS**  
What a treasure had he, my lord?

**HAMLET**  
Why,

*\[Recites]*
'One fair daughter and no more,  
The which he loved passing well.'

*Enter two Players*

You are welcome, masters; welcome, all. I am glad  
to see thee well. Welcome, good friends.  
We'll have a speech straight: come, give us a taste  
of your quality; come, a passionate speech.

**First Player**  
What speech, my lord?

**HAMLET**  
I heard thee speak me a speech once, but it was  
never acted; or, if it was, not above once but it was  
an excellent play, well digested in the scenes, set  
down with as much modesty as cunning. One speech in it I  
chiefly loved: 'twas Aeneas' tale to Dido; and  
thereabout of it especially, where he speaks of  
Priam's slaughter: if it live in your memory, begin  
at this line: let me see, let me see--

*\[Recites]*  
'The rugged Pyrrhus, he whose sable arms,  
Black as his purpose, did the night resemble  
When he lay couched in the ominous horse,  
Hath now this dread and black complexion smear'd  
With heraldry more dismal; head to foot  
Now is he total ghouls; horridly trick'd  
With blood of fathers, mothers, daughters, sons,  
Baked and impasted with the parching streets,  
That lend a tyrannous and damned light  
To their lord's murder: roasted in wrath and fire,  
And thus o'er-sized with coagulate gore,  
With eyes like carbuncles, the hellish Pyrrhus  
Old grandsire Priam seeks.' /

**First Player**  
/ 'Anon he finds him  
Striking too short at Greeks; his antique sword,  
Rebellious to his arm, lies where it falls,  
Repugnant to command: unequal match'd,  
Pyrrhus at Priam drives; in rage strikes wide;  
But with the whiff and wind of his fell sword  
The unnerved father falls. Then senseless Ilium,  
Seeming to feel this blow, with flaming top  
Stoops to his base, and with a hideous crash  
Takes prisoner Pyrrhus' ear: for, lo! his sword,  
Which was declining on the milky head  
Of reverend Priam, seem'd i' the air to stick:  
So, as a painted tyrant, Pyrrhus stood,  
And like a neutral to his will and matter,  
Did nothing.  
But, as we often see, against some storm,  
The bold winds speechless and the orb below  
As hush as death, anon the dreadful thunder  
Doth rend the region, so, after Pyrrhus' pause,  
Aroused vengeance sets him new a-work;  
And never did the Cyclops' hammers fall  
On Mars's armor forged for proof eterne  
With less remorse than Pyrrhus' bleeding sword  
Now falls on Priam.  
Out, out, thou strumpet, Fortune! All you gods,  
In general synod 'take away her power;  
Break all the spokes and fellies from her wheel,  
And bowl the round nave down the hill of heaven,  
As low as to the fiends!' /

**LORD POLONIUS**  
/ This is too long.

**HAMLET**  
It shall to the barber's, with your beard. Prithee, say on!

**First Player**  
'But who, O, who had seen the mobled queen-'  
'Run barefoot up and down, threatening the flames  
With bisson rheum; a clout upon that head  
Where late the diadem stood, and for a robe,  
About her lank and all o'er-teemed loins,  
Who this had seen, with tongue in venom steep'd,  
'Gainst Fortune's state would treason have pronounced:  
But if the gods themselves did see her then  
When she saw Pyrrhus make malicious sport  
In mincing with his sword her husband's limbs,  
The instant burst of clamor that she made,  
Unless things mortal move them not at all,  
Would have made milch the burning eyes of heaven,  
And passion in the gods.'

**LORD POLONIUS**  
Look, whether he has not turned his color and has  
tears in's eyes. Pray you, no more.

**HAMLET**  
'Tis well: I'll have thee speak out the rest soon.

**LORD POLONIUS**  
Come, sirs.

**HAMLET**  
Follow him, friends: we'll hear a play tomorrow.

*Exit POLONIUS with all the Players but the First*

Dost thou hear me, old friend; can you play the  
Murder of Gonzago?

**First Player**  
Ay, my lord.

**HAMLET**  
We'll ha't tomorrow night. You could, for a need,  
study a speech of some dozen or sixteen lines, which  
I would set down and insert in't, could you not?

**First Player**  
Ay, my lord.

**HAMLET**  
Very well. Follow that lord; and look you mock him  
not.

*Exit First Player*

O, what a rogue and peasant slave am I!  
Is it not monstrous that this player here,  
Could force his soul so to his own conceit  
That from her working all his visage wann'd,  
Tears in his eyes, distraction in's aspect,  
A broken voice, and his whole function suiting  
With forms to his conceit? and all for nothing!  
For Hecuba!  
What's Hecuba to him, or he to Hecuba,  
That he should weep for her? What would he do,  
Had he the motive and the cue for passion  
That I have? He would drown the stage with tears  
And cleave the general ear with horrid speech,  
Make mad the guilty and appal the free,  
Confound the ignorant, and amaze indeed  
The very faculties of eyes and ears. Yet I,  
A dull and muddy-mettled rascal, peak,  
And can say nothing; no, not for a king,  
Upon whose property and most dear life  
A damn'd defeat was made. Am I a coward?  
Ha!  
'Swounds, I should take it: for it cannot be  
But I am pigeon-liver'd and lack gall  
To make oppression bitter, or ere this  
I should have fatted all the region kites  
With this slave's offal: bloody, bawdy villain!  
O, vengeance!  
Why, what an ass am I! This is most brave,  
That I, the son of a dear father murder'd,  
Prompted to my revenge by heaven and hell,  
Must, like a whore, unpack my heart with words,  
And fall a-cursing, like a very drab,  
Fie upon't! foh! About, my brain! I have heard  
That guilty creatures sitting at a play  
Have by the very cunning of the scene  
Been struck so to the soul that presently  
They have proclaim'd their malefactions;  
For murder, though it have no tongue, will speak  
With most miraculous organ. I'll have these players  
Play something like the murder of my father  
Before mine uncle: I'll observe his looks;  
I know my course. The spirit that I have seen  
May be the devil: and the devil hath power  
To assume a pleasing shape; yea, and perhaps  
Out of my weakness and my melancholy,  
Abuses me to damn me: I'll have grounds  
More relative than this: the play's the thing  
Wherein I'll catch the conscience of the king.

*Exit*

## ACT III

### SCENE I. A room in the castle.

*Enter KING CLAUDIUS, QUEEN GERTRUDE, POLONIUS, OPHELIA, ROSENCRANTZ,
and GUILDENSTERN*

**KING CLAUDIUS**  
And can you, by no drift of circumstance,  
Get from him why he puts on this confusion,  
With turbulent and dangerous lunacy?

**ROSENCRANTZ**  
He does confess he feels himself distracted;  
But from what cause he will by no means speak.

**QUEEN GERTRUDE**  
Did you assay him to any pastime?

**ROSENCRANTZ**  
Madam, it so fell out, that certain players  
We o'er-raught on the way: of these we told him;  
And there did seem in him a kind of joy  
To hear of it: they are about the court,  
And, as I think, they have already order  
This night to play before him. /

**LORD POLONIUS**  
/ 'Tis most true:  
And he beseech'd me to entreat your majesties  
To hear and see the matter.

**KING CLAUDIUS**  
With all my heart; and it doth much content me  
To hear him so inclined.  
Good gentlemen, give him a further edge,  
And drive his purpose on to these delights.

**ROSENCRANTZ**  
We shall, my lord.

*Exeunt ROSENCRANTZ & GUILDENSTERN*

**KING CLAUDIUS**  
Sweet Gertrude, leave us too;  
For we have closely sent for Hamlet hither,  
That he, as 'twere by accident, may here  
Affront Ophelia:  
Her father and myself, lawful espials,  
Will so bestow ourselves that, seeing, unseen,  
We may of their encounter frankly judge,  
If 't be the affliction of his love or no  
That thus he suffers for. /

**QUEEN GERTRUDE**  
/ I shall obey you.  
And for your part, Ophelia, I do wish  
That your good beauties be the happy cause  
Of Hamlet's wildness: so shall I hope your virtues  
Will bring him to his wonted way again,  
To both your honours. /

**OPHELIA**  
/ Madam, I wish it may.

*Exit QUEEN GERTRUDE*

**LORD POLONIUS**  
I hear him coming: let's withdraw, my lord.

*Exeunt KING CLAUDIUS and POLONIUS*

*Enter HAMLET*

**HAMLET**  
To be, or not to be: that is the question:  
Whether 'tis nobler in the mind to suffer  
The slings and arrows of outrageous fortune,  
Or to take arms against a sea of troubles,  
And by opposing end them? To die: to sleep;  
No more; and by a sleep to say we end  
The heart-ache and the thousand natural shocks  
That flesh is heir to, 'tis a consummation  
Devoutly to be wish'd. To die, to sleep;  
To sleep: perchance to dream: ay, there's the rub;  
For in that sleep of death what dreams may come  
When we have shuffled off this mortal coil,  
Must give us pause: there's the respect  
That makes calamity of so long life;  
For who would bear the whips and scorns of Time,  
The oppressor's wrong, the proud man's contumely,  
The pangs of despised love, the law's delay,  
The insolence of office and the spurns  
That patient merit of the unworthy takes,  
When he himself might his quietus make  
With a bare bodkin? who would fardels bear,  
To grunt and sweat under a weary life,  
But that the dread of something after death,  
The undiscover'd country from whose bourn  
No traveller returns, puzzles the will  
And makes us rather bear those ills we have  
Than fly to others that we know not of?  
Thus conscience does make cowards of us all;  
And thus the native hue of resolution  
Is sicklied o'er with the pale cast of thought,  
And enterprises of great pith and moment  
With this regard their currents turn awry,  
And lose the name of action.--Soft you now!  
The fair Ophelia! Nymph, in thy orisons  
Be all my sins remember'd. /

**OPHELIA**  
/ God-den, sir.  
My lord, I have remembrances of yours,  
That I have longed long to re-deliver;  
I pray you, now receive them. /

**HAMLET**  
/ No, not I;  
I never gave you aught.

**OPHELIA**  
My honour'd lord, you know right well you did;  
And, with them, words of so sweet breath composed  
As made the things more rich: their perfume lost,  
Take these again; for to the noble mind  
Rich gifts wax poor when givers prove unkind.

**HAMLET**  
Ha, ha! are you honest? Are you fair?

**OPHELIA**  
What means your lordship?

**HAMLET**  
That if you be honest and fair, your honesty should  
admit no discourse to your beauty.

**OPHELIA**  
Could beauty, my lord, have better commerce than  
with honesty?

**HAMLET**  
Ay, truly; for the power of beauty will sooner  
transform honesty from what it is to a bawd than the  
force of honesty can translate beauty into his  
likeness: this was sometime a paradox, but now the  
time gives it proof. I did love you once.

**OPHELIA**  
Indeed, my lord, you made me believe so.

**HAMLET**  
You should not have believed me; for virtue cannot  
so inoculate our old stock but we shall relish of  
it: I loved you not.

**OPHELIA**  
I was the more deceived.

**HAMLET**  
Get thee to a nunnery: why wouldst thou be a  
breeder of sinners? I am myself indifferent honest;  
but yet I could accuse me of such things that it  
were better my mother had not borne me: I am very  
proud, revengeful, ambitious, with more offences at  
my beck than I have thoughts to put them in,  
imagination to give them shape, or time to act them  
in. What should such fellows as I do crawling  
between earth and heaven? We are arrant knaves,  
all; believe none of us. Go thy ways to a nunnery.  
Where's your father?

**OPHELIA**  
At home, my lord.

**HAMLET**  
Let the doors be shut upon him, that he may play the  
fool no where but in's own house. Farewell.

**OPHELIA**  
O, help him, you sweet heavens!

**HAMLET**  
If thou dost marry, I'll give thee this plague for  
thy dowry: be thou as chaste as ice, as pure as  
snow, thou shalt not escape calumny. Get thee to a  
nunnery, go: farewell. Or, if thou wilt needs  
marry, marry a fool; for wise men know well enough  
what monsters you make of them. To a nunnery, go,  
and quickly too. Farewell.

**OPHELIA**  
O heavenly powers, restore him!

**HAMLET**  
I have heard of your paintings too, well enough; God  
has given you one face, and you make yourselves  
another: you jig, you amble, and you lisp, and  
nick-name God's creatures, and make your wantonness  
your ignorance. Go to, I'll no more on't; it hath  
made me mad. I say, we will have no more marriages:  
those that are married already, all but one, shall  
live; the rest shall keep as they are. To a  
nunnery, go.

*Exit*

**OPHELIA**  
O, what a noble mind is here o'erthrown!  
The courtier's, soldier's, scholar's, eye, tongue, sword;  
The expectancy and rose of the fair state,  
The glass of fashion and the mold of form,  
The observed of all observers, quite, quite down!  
And I, of ladies most deject and wretched,  
That suck'd the honey of his music vows,  
Now see that noble and most sovereign reason,  
Like sweet bells jangled, out of tune and harsh;  
That unmatch'd form and feature of blown youth  
Blasted with ecstasy: O, woe is me,  
To have seen what I have seen, see what I see!

*Re-enter KING CLAUDIUS and POLONIUS*

**KING CLAUDIUS**  
Love! his affections do not that way tend;  
There's something in his soul,  
O'er which his melancholy sits on brood;  
And I do doubt the hatch and the disclose  
Will be some danger: he shall with speed to England,  
For the demand of our neglected tribute  
Haply the seas and countries different  
With variable objects shall expel  
This something-settled matter in his heart.

**LORD POLONIUS**  
It shall do well: but yet do I believe  
The origin and commencement of his grief  
Sprung from neglected love. How now, Ophelia!  
You need not tell us what Lord Hamlet said;  
We heard it all. My lord, do as you please;  
But, if you hold it fit, after the play  
Let his queen mother all alone entreat him  
To show his grief: let her be round with him;  
And I'll be placed, so please you, in the ear  
Of all their conference. If she find him not,  
To England send him, or confine him where  
Your wisdom best shall think.

**KING CLAUDIUS**  
It shall be so:  
Madness in great ones must not unwatch'd go.

*Exeunt*

### SCENE II. A hall in the castle.

*Enter HAMLET and Players*

**HAMLET**  
Speak the speech, I pray you, as I pronounced it to  
you, trippingly on the tongue: but if you mouth it,  
as many of your players do, I had as lief the  
town-crier spoke my lines. Nor do not saw the air  
too much with your hand, thus, but use all gently;  
for in the very torrent, tempest, and, as I may say,  
the whirlwind of passion, you must acquire and beget  
a temperance that may give it smoothness. O, it  
offends me to the soul to hear a robustious  
periwig-pated fellow tear a passion to tatters, to  
very rags, to split the ears of the groundlings, who  
for the most part are capable of nothing but  
inexplicable dumbshows and noise: I would have such  
a fellow whipped for o'erdoing Termagant; it  
out-herods Herod: pray you, avoid it.

**First Player**  
I warrant your honor.

**HAMLET**  
Be not too tame neither, but let your own discretion  
be your tutor: suit the action to the word, the  
word to the action; with this special o'erstep not  
the modesty of nature: for anything so overdone is  
from the purpose of playing, whose end, both at the  
first and now, was and is, to hold, as 'twere, the  
mirror up to nature; to show virtue her own feature,  
scorn her own image, and the very age and body of  
the time his form and pressure.

*Exeunt Players*

*Enter POLONIUS, ROSENCRANTZ, and GUILDENSTERN*

**HAMLET**  
What ho! Horatio! /

*Enter HORATIO*

**HORATIO**  
/ Here, sweet lord, at your service.

**HAMLET**  
There is a play tonight before the king;  
One scene of it comes near the circumstance  
Which I have told thee of my father's death:  
I prithee, when thou seest that act afoot,  
Even with the very comment of thy soul  
Observe mine uncle: if his occulted guilt  
Do not itself unkennel in one speech,  
It is a damned ghost that we have seen,  
And my imaginations are as foul  
As Vulcan's stithy. /

**HORATIO**  
/ Well, my lord:  
If he steal aught the whilst this play is playing,  
And 'scape detecting, I will pay the theft.

**HAMLET**  
They are coming to the play; I must be idle:  
Get you a place.

*Danish march. A flourish. Enter KING CLAUDIUS, QUEEN GERTRUDE,
POLONIUS, OPHELIA, ROSENCRANTZ, and GUILDENSTERN*

**KING CLAUDIUS**  
How fares our cousin Hamlet?

**HAMLET**  
Excellent, i' faith; of the chameleon's dish: I eat  
the air, promise-crammed: you cannot feed capons so.

**KING CLAUDIUS**  
I have nothing with this answer, Hamlet; these words  
are not mine.

**HAMLET**  
No, nor mine now.

*\[To POLONIUS]*  
My lord, you played once i' the university, you say?

**LORD POLONIUS**  
That did I, my lord; and was accounted a good actor.

**HAMLET**  
What did you enact?

**LORD POLONIUS**  
I did enact Julius Caesar: I was killed i' the  
Capitol; Brutus killed me.

**HAMLET**  
It was a brute part of him to kill so capital a calf  
there. Be the players ready?

**ROSENCRANTZ**  
Ay, my lord; they stay upon your patience.

**HAMLET**  
Lady, shall I lie in your lap?

*Lying down at OPHELIA 's feet*

**OPHELIA**  
No, my lord.

**HAMLET**  
I mean, my head upon your lap?

**OPHELIA**  
Ay, my lord.

**HAMLET**  
Do you think I meant country matters?

**OPHELIA**  
I think nothing, my lord.

**HAMLET**  
That's a fair thought to lie between maids' legs.

**OPHELIA**  
What is, my lord?

**HAMLET**  
Nothing.

**OPHELIA**  
You are merry, my lord.

**HAMLET**  
Who, I?

**OPHELIA**  
Ay, my lord.

**HAMLET**  
O God, your only jig-maker. What should a man do  
but be merry? for, look you, how cheerfully my  
mother looks, and my father died within these two hours.

**OPHELIA**  
Nay, 'tis twice two months, my lord.

**HAMLET**  
So long? Nay then, let the devil wear black, for  
I'll have a suit of sables. O heavens! die two  
months ago, and not forgotten yet? Then there's  
hope a great man's memory may outlive his life half  
a year.

*Hautboys play. The dumb-show enters*

*Enter a King and a Queen very lovingly; the Queen embracing him, and he
her. She kneels, and makes show of protestation unto him. He takes her
up, and declines his head upon her neck: lays him down upon a bank of
flowers: she, seeing him asleep, leaves him. Anon comes in a fellow,
takes off his crown, kisses it, and pours poison in the King 's ears,
and exit. The Queen returns; finds the King dead, and makes passionate
action. The Poisoner, with some two or three Mutes, comes in again,
seeming to lament with her. The dead body is carried away. The Poisoner
wooes the Queen with gifts: she seems loath and unwilling awhile, but in
the end accepts his love*

*Exeunt*

**OPHELIA**  
What means this, my lord?

**HAMLET**  
We shall know by this fellow: the players cannot  
keep counsel; they'll tell all.

*Enter two Players, King and Queen*

**Player Queen**  
So many journeys may the sun and moon  
Make us again count o'er ere love be done!  
But, woe is me, you are so sick of late,  
So far from cheer and from your former state,  
That I distrust you. Yet, though I distrust,  
Discomfort you, my lord, it nothing must:  
Now, what my love is, proof hath made you know;  
And as my love is sized, my fear is so:  
Where love is great, the littlest doubts are fear;  
Where little fears grow great, great love grows there.

**Player King**  
'Faith, I must leave thee, love, and shortly too;  
My operant powers their functions leave to do:  
And thou shalt live in this fair world behind,  
Honor'd, beloved; and haply one as kind  
For husband shalt thou-- /

**Player Queen**  
/ O, confound the rest!  
Such love must needs be treason in my breast:  
In second husband let me be accurst!  
None wed the second but who kill'd the first.  
A second time I kill my husband dead,  
When second husband kisses me in bed.

**Player King**  
I do believe you think what now you speak;  
But what we do determine oft we break.  
So think thou wilt no second husband wed;  
But die thy thoughts when thy first lord is dead.

**Player Queen**  
Nor earth to me give food, nor heaven light!  
Sport and repose lock from me day and night!  
Each opposite that blanks the face of joy  
Meet what I would have well and it destroy!  
Both here and hence pursue me lasting strife,  
If, once a widow, ever I be wife!

**Player King**  
'Tis deeply sworn. Sweet, leave me here awhile;  
My spirits grow dull, and fain I would beguile  
The tedious day with sleep. /
*\[Sleeps]*

**Player Queen**  
/ Sleep rock thy brain,  
And never come mischance between us twain!

*Exit*

**HAMLET**  
Madam, how like you this play?

**QUEEN GERTRUDE**  
The lady protests too much, methinks.

**HAMLET**  
O, but she'll keep her word.

**KING CLAUDIUS**  
What do you call the play?

**HAMLET**  
The Mouse-trap. Marry, how? Tropically. This play  
is the image of a murder done in Vienna: Gonzago is  
the duke's name; his wife, Baptista: you shall see  
anon; 'tis a knavish piece of work: but what o'  
that? your majesty and we that have free souls, it  
touches us not: let the galled jade wince, our  
withers are unwrung.

*Enter LUCIANUS*

This is one Lucianus, nephew to the king.

**OPHELIA**  
You are as good as a chorus, my lord.

**HAMLET**  
I could interpret between you and your love, if I  
could see the puppets dallying.

**OPHELIA**  
You are keen, my lord, you are keen.

**LUCIANUS**  
Thou mixture rank, of midnight weeds collected,  
With Hecate's ban thrice blasted, thrice infected,  
Thy natural magic and dire property,  
On wholesome life usurp immediately.  
*\[Pours the poison into the sleeper 's ears]*

**HAMLET**  
You shall see anon how the murderer gets the love of  
Gonzago's wife.

**OPHELIA**  
The king rises. /

**HAMLET**  
/ What, frighted with false fire!

**QUEEN GERTRUDE**  
How fares my lord? /

**LORD POLONIUS**  
/ Give o'er the play.

**KING CLAUDIUS**  
Give me some light: away!

*Exeunt all but HAMLET and HORATIO*

**HAMLET**  
O good Horatio, I'll take the ghost's word for a  
thousand pound. Didst perceive?

**HORATIO**  
Very well, my lord.

**HAMLET**  
Upon the talk of the poisoning?

**HORATIO**  
I did very well note him.

**HAMLET**  
Ah, ha! Come, some music! come, the recorders!  
For if the king like not the comedy,  
Why then, belike, he likes it not, perdy.

*Re-enter ROSENCRANTZ & GUILDENSTERN*

**GUILDENSTERN**  
Good my lord, vouchsafe me a word with you.

**HAMLET**  
Sir, a whole history.

**GUILDENSTERN**  
The king, sir,--

**HAMLET**  
Ay, sir, what of him?

**GUILDENSTERN**  
Is in his retirement marvellous distempered.

**HAMLET**  
With drink, sir?

**GUILDENSTERN**  
No, my lord, rather with choler.

**HAMLET**  
Your wisdom should show itself more richer to  
signify this to his doctor; for, for me to put him  
to his purgation would perhaps plunge him into far  
more choler.

**GUILDENSTERN**  
Good my lord, put your discourse into some frame and  
start not so wildly from my affair.

**HAMLET**  
I am tame, sir: pronounce.

**GUILDENSTERN**  
The queen, your mother, in most great affliction of  
spirit, hath sent me to you. She desires to speak  
with you in her closet, ere you go to bed.

**HAMLET**  
We shall obey, were she ten times our mother. Have  
you any further trade with us?

**ROSENCRANTZ**  
My lord, you once did love me.

**HAMLET**  
So I do still, by these pickers and stealers.

*Re-enter Players with recorders*

O, the recorders! let me see one. To withdraw with  
you:-why do you go about to recover the wind of me,  
as if you would drive me into a toil?

**GUILDENSTERN**  
O, my lord, if my duty be too bold, my love is too  
unmannerly.

**HAMLET**  
I do not well understand that. Will you play upon  
this pipe?

**GUILDENSTERN**  
My lord, I cannot.

**HAMLET**  
Why, look you now, how unworthy a thing you make of  
me! You would play upon me; you would seem to know  
my stops; you would pluck out the heart of my  
mystery; you would sound me from my lowest note to  
the top of my compass: and there is much music,  
excellent voice, in this little organ; yet cannot  
you make it speak. 'Sblood, do you think I am  
easier to be played on than a pipe? Call me what  
instrument you will, though you can fret me, yet you  
cannot play upon me.

*Enter POLONIUS*

**LORD POLONIUS**  
My lord, the queen would speak with you, and presently.

**HAMLET**  
Do you see yonder cloud that's almost in shape of a camel?

**LORD POLONIUS**  
By the mass, and 'tis like a camel, indeed.

**HAMLET**  
Methinks it is like a weasel.

**LORD POLONIUS**  
It is backed like a weasel.

**HAMLET**  
Or like a whale?

**LORD POLONIUS**  
Very like a whale.

**HAMLET**  
Then I will come to my mother by and by.

*Exit POLONIUS*

Leave me, friends.

*Exeunt all but HAMLET*

Tis now the very witching time of night,  
When churchyards yawn and hell itself breathes out  
Contagion to this world: now could I drink hot blood,  
And do such bitter business as the day  
Would quake to look on. Soft! now to my mother.  
O heart, lose not thy nature; let not ever  
The soul of Nero enter this firm bosom:  
Let me be cruel, not unnatural:  
I will speak daggers to her, but use none;  
My tongue and soul in this be hypocrites;  
How in my words soever she be shent,  
To give them seals never, my soul, consent!

*Exit*

## INTERMISSION

### SCENE III. A room in the castle.

*Enter KING CLAUDIUS, ROSENCRANTZ, and GUILDENSTERN*

**KING CLAUDIUS**  
I like him not, nor stands it safe with us  
To let his madness range. Therefore prepare you;  
I your commission will forthwith dispatch,  
And he to England shall along with you:  
Arm you, I pray you, to this speedy voyage;  
For we will fetters put upon this fear,  
Which now goes too free-footed.

**ROSENCRANTZ & GUILDENSTERN**  
We will haste us.

*Exeunt ROSENCRANTZ & GUILDENSTERN*

*Enter POLONIUS*

**LORD POLONIUS**  
My lord, he's going to his mother's closet:  
Behind the arras I'll convey myself,  
To hear the process; and warrant she'll tax him home:  
'Tis meet that some more audience than a mother,  
Since nature makes them partial, should o'erhear  
The speech, of vantage. Fare you well, my liege:  
I'll call upon you ere you go to bed,  
And tell you what I know. /

**KING CLAUDIUS**  
/ Thanks, dear my lord.

*Exit POLONIUS*

O, my offence is rank it smells to heaven;  
A brother's murder. Pray can I not,  
Though inclination be as sharp as will:  
My stronger guilt defeats my strong intent;  
And, like a man to double business bound,  
I stand in pause where I shall first begin,  
And both neglect. What if this cursed hand  
Were thicker than itself with brother's blood,  
Is there not rain enough in the sweet heavens  
To wash it white as snow? Whereto serves mercy  
And what's in prayer but this two-fold force,  
To be forestalled ere we come to fall,  
Or pardon'd being down? Then I'll look up;  
My fault is past. But, O, what form of prayer  
Can serve my turn? 'Forgive me my foul murder'?  
That cannot be; since I am still possess'd  
Of those effects for which I did the murder,  
My crown, mine own ambition and my queen.  
May one be pardon'd and retain the offence?  
Try what repentance can: what can it not?  
Yet what can it when one cannot repent?  
O limed soul, that, struggling to be free,  
Art more engaged! Help, angels! Make assay!  
Bow, stubborn knees; and, heart with strings of steel,  
Be soft as sinews of the newborn babe!  
*\[Retires and kneels]*

*Enter HAMLET*

**HAMLET**  
Now might I do it pat, now he is praying;  
And now I'll do't. And so he goes to heaven;  
And so am I revenged. That would be scann'd:  
A villain kills my father; and for that,  
I, his sole son, do this same villain send  
To heaven.  
O, this is hire and salary, not revenge.  
He took my father grossly, full of bread;  
And how his audit stands who knows save heaven?  
But in our circumstance and course of thought,  
'Tis heavy with him: and am I then revenged,  
To take him in the purging of his soul,  
When he is fit and season'd for his passage?  
No!  
Up, sword; and know thou a more horrid hent:  
When he is drunk asleep, or in his rage,  
Or in the incestuous pleasure of his bed;  
Then trip him, that his heels may kick at heaven,  
And that his soul may be as damn'd and black  
As hell, whereto it goes. My mother stays:  
This physic but prolongs thy sickly days.

*Exit*

**KING CLAUDIUS**  
*\[Rising]*  
My words fly up, my thoughts remain below:  
Words without thoughts never to heaven go.

*Exit*

### SCENE IV. The Queen's closet.

*Enter QUEEN GERTRUDE and POLONIUS*

**LORD POLONIUS**  
He will come straight. Look you lay home to him:  
Tell him his pranks have been too broad to bear with.

*POLONIUS hides behind the arras*

*Enter HAMLET*

**HAMLET**  
Now, mother, what's the matter?

**QUEEN GERTRUDE**  
Hamlet, thou hast thy father much offended.

**HAMLET**  
Mother, you have my father much offended.

**QUEEN GERTRUDE**  
Come, come, you answer with an idle tongue.

**HAMLET**  
Go, go, you question with a wicked tongue.

**QUEEN GERTRUDE**  
Have you forgot me? /

**HAMLET**  
/ No, by the rood, not so:  
You are the queen, your husband's brother's wife;  
And--would it were not so!--you are my mother.

**QUEEN GERTRUDE**  
Nay, then, I'll set those to you that can speak.

**HAMLET**  
Come, come, and sit you down; you shall not budge;  
You go not till I set you up a glass  
Where you may see the inmost part of you.

**QUEEN GERTRUDE**  
What wilt thou do? thou wilt not murder me?  
Help, help, ho!

**LORD POLONIUS**  
*\[Behind]*  
What, ho! help, help, help!

**HAMLET**  
*\[Drawing]*  
How now! a rat? Dead, for a ducat, dead!

*Makes a pass through the arras*

**LORD POLONIUS**  
*\[Behind]*  
O, I am slain!

*\[Falls and dies]*

**QUEEN GERTRUDE**  
O me, what hast thou done? /

**HAMLET**  
/ Nay, I know not:  
Is it the king?

**QUEEN GERTRUDE**  
O, what a rash and bloody deed is this!

**HAMLET**  
A bloody deed! almost as bad, good mother,  
As kill a king, and marry with his brother.

**QUEEN GERTRUDE**  
As kill a king! /

**HAMLET**  
/ Ay, lady, 'twas my word.

*Lifts up the arras and discovers POLONIUS*

Thou wretched, rash, intruding fool, farewell!

**QUEEN GERTRUDE**  
What have I done, that thou darest wag thy tongue  
In noise so rude against me? /

**HAMLET**  
/ Such an act  
That blurs the grace and blush of modesty.  
Look here, upon this picture, and on this,  
The counterfeit presentment of two brothers.  
See, what a grace was seated on this brow;  
An eye like Mars, to threaten and command;  
A combination and a form indeed,  
Where every god did seem to set his seal,  
To give the world assurance of a man:  
This was your husband. Look you now, what follows:  
Here is your husband; like a mildew'd ear,  
Blasting his wholesome brother. Have you eyes?  
You cannot call it love; for at your age  
The hey-day in the blood is tame, it's humble,  
And waits upon the judgment: and what judgment  
Would step from this to this? Sense, sure, you have,  
Else could you not have motion; but sure, that sense  
Is apoplex'd; for madness would not err,  
But it reserved some quantity of choice,  
To serve in such a difference. What devil was't  
That thus hath cozen'd you at hoodman-blind?  
O shame! where is thy blush?

**QUEEN GERTRUDE**  
O Hamlet, speak no more:  
Thou turn'st mine eyes into my very soul;  
And there I see such black and grained spots  
As will not leave their tinct. /

**HAMLET**  
/ Nay, but to live  
In the rank sweat of an enseamed bed,  
Stew'd in corruption, honeying and making love  
Over the nasty sty,-- /

**QUEEN GERTRUDE**  
/ O, speak to me no more;  
These words, like daggers, enter in mine ears;  
No more, sweet Hamlet! /

**HAMLET**  
/ A murderer and a villain;  
That from a shelf the precious diadem stole,  
And put it in his pocket! /

**QUEEN GERTRUDE**  
/ No more!

**HAMLET**  
A king of shreds and patches,--

*Enter Ghost*

Save me, and hover o'er me with your wings,  
You heavenly guards! What would your gracious figure?

**QUEEN GERTRUDE**  
Alas, he's mad! /

**Ghost**  
/ Do not forget: this visitation  
Is but to whet thy almost blunted purpose.  
But, look, amazement on thy mother sits:  
O, step between her and her fighting soul:  
Conceit in weakest bodies strongest works:  
Speak to her, Hamlet.

**HAMLET**  
How is it with you, lady? /

**QUEEN GERTRUDE**  
/ Alas, how is't with you,  
That you do bend your eye on vacancy  
And with the incorporal air do hold discourse?  
Forth at your eyes your spirits wildly peep;  
Your bedded hair, like life in excrements,  
Starts up, and stands on end. O gentle son,  
Upon the heat and flame of thy distemper  
Sprinkle cool patience. Whereon do you look?

**HAMLET**  
On him, on him! Look you, how pale he glares!  
Do you see nothing there?

**QUEEN GERTRUDE**  
Nothing at all; yet all that is I see.

**HAMLET**  
Nor did you nothing hear?

**QUEEN GERTRUDE**  
No, nothing but ourselves.

**HAMLET**  
Why, look you there! look, how it steals away!  
My father, in his habit as he lived!  
Look, where he goes, even now, out at the portal!

*Exit Ghost*

**QUEEN GERTRUDE**  
This the very coinage of your brain:  
This bodiless creation ecstasy  
Is very cunning in. /

**HAMLET**  
/ Ecstasy!  
My pulse, as yours, doth temperately keep time,  
And makes as healthful music: it is not madness  
That I have utter'd: Mother, for love of grace,  
Lay not that mattering unction to your soul,  
That not your trespass, but my madness speaks:  
It will but skin and film the ulcerous place,  
Whilst rank corruption, mining all within,  
Infects unseen. Confess yourself to heaven;  
Repent what's past; avoid what is to come;  
And do not spread the compost on the weeds,  
To make them ranker. Forgive me this my virtue;

**QUEEN GERTRUDE**  
O Hamlet, thou hast cleft my heart in twain.

**HAMLET**  
O, throw away the worser part of it,  
And live the purer with the other half.  
Good night: but go not to mine uncle's bed;  
And that shall lend a kind of easiness  
To the next abstinence: the next more easy;  
For use almost can change the stamp of nature,  
And either the devil, or throw him out  
With wondrous potency. Once more, good night:  
And when you are desirous to be bless'd,  
I'll blessing beg of you. /

**QUEEN GERTRUDE**  
/ What shall I do?

**HAMLET**  
Not this, by no means, that I bid you do:  
Let the bloat king tempt you again to bed;  
And let him, for a pair of reechy kisses,  
Make you to ravel all this matter out,  
That I essentially am not in madness,  
But mad in craft. 'Twere good you let him know.

**QUEEN GERTRUDE**  
Be thou assured, if words be made of breath,  
And breath of life, I have no life to breathe  
What thou hast said to me.

**HAMLET**  
I must to England; you know that? /

**QUEEN GERTRUDE**  
/ Alack,  
I had forgot: 'tis so concluded on.

**HAMLET**  
There's letters seal'd: and my two schoolfellows,  
Whom I will trust as I will adders fang'd,  
They bear the mandate; they must sweep my way,  
And marshal me to knavery. Let it work;  
This man shall set me packing:  
I'll lug the guts into the neighbor room.  
Mother, good night. Indeed this counsellor  
Is now most still, most secret and most grave,  
Who was in life a foolish prating knave.  
Come, sir, to draw toward an end with you.  
Good night, mother.

*Exeunt severally; HAMLET dragging in POLONIUS*

## ACT IV

### SCENE I. A room in the castle.

*Enter KING CLAUDIUS, QUEEN GERTRUDE*

**KING CLAUDIUS**  
What, Gertrude? How does Hamlet?

**QUEEN GERTRUDE**  
Mad as the sea and wind, when both contend  
Which is the mightier: in his lawless fit,  
Behind the arras hearing something stir,  
Whips out his rapier, cries, 'A rat, a rat!'  
And, in this brainish apprehension, kills  
The unseen good old man. /

**KING CLAUDIUS**  
/ O heavy deed!  
It had been so with us, had we been there.  
Come, Gertrude, we'll call up our wisest friends;  
And let them know, both what we mean to do,  
And what's untimely done. O, come away!  
My soul is full of discord and dismay.

*Exeunt*

### SCENE III. Another room in the castle.

*Enter KING CLAUDIUS*

*Enter ROSENCRANTZ, HAMLET and GUILDENSTERN*

**KING CLAUDIUS**  
Now, Hamlet, where's Polonius?

**HAMLET**  
At supper.

**KING CLAUDIUS**  
At supper! where?

**HAMLET**  
Not where he eats, but where he is eaten: a certain  
convocation of politic worms are e'en at him.

**KING CLAUDIUS**  
Where is Polonius?

**HAMLET**  
In heaven; send hither to see: if your messenger  
find him not there, seek him i' the other place  
yourself. But indeed, if you find him not within  
this month, you shall nose him as you go up the  
stairs into the lobby.

**KING CLAUDIUS**  
Hamlet, this deed, for thine especial safety,--  
Which we do tender, as we dearly grieve  
For that which thou hast done,--must send thee hence  
For England. /

**HAMLET**  
/ For England! /

**KING CLAUDIUS**  
/ Ay, Hamlet. /

**HAMLET**  
/ Good.

**KING CLAUDIUS**  
So is it, if thou knew'st our purposes.

**HAMLET**  
I see a cherub that sees them. But, come; for  
England! Farewell, dear mother.

**KING CLAUDIUS**  
Thy loving father, Hamlet.

**HAMLET**  
My mother: father and mother is man and wife; man  
and wife is one flesh; and so, my mother. Come, for England!

*Exit*

**KING CLAUDIUS**  
Follow him at foot; tempt him with speed aboard;  
Away! for everything is seal'd and done  
That else leans on the affair: pray you, make haste.

*Exeunt ROSENCRANTZ and GUILDENSTERN*

*Exit*

### SCENE IV. A plain in Denmark.

*Enter FORTINBRAS, and a Captain*

**PRINCE FORTINBRAS**  
Go, captain, from me greet the Danish king;  
Tell him that, by his license, Fortinbras  
Craves the conveyance of a promised march  
Over his kingdom. /

**Captain**  
/ I will do't, my lord.

*Exeunt FORTINBRAS*

*Enter HAMLET, ROSENCRANTZ, and GUILDENSTERN*

**HAMLET**  
Good sir, whose powers are these?

**Captain**  
They are of Norway, sir.

**HAMLET**  
How purposed, sir, I pray you?

**Captain**  
Against some part of Poland.

**HAMLET**  
Who commands them, sir?

**Captain**  
The nephews to old Norway, Fortinbras.

**HAMLET**  
Goes it against the main of Poland, sir,  
Or for some frontier?

**Captain**  
We go to gain a little patch of ground  
That hath in it no profit but the name.  
To pay five ducats, five, I would not farm it;  
Nor will it yield to Norway or the Pole  
A ranker rate, should it be sold in fee.  
God be wi' you, sir.

*Exeunt all except HAMLET*

**HAMLET**  
How all occasions do inform against me,  
And spur my dull revenge! What is a man,  
If his chief good and market of his time  
Be but to sleep and feed? a beast, no more.  
Witness this army of such mass and charge  
Led by a delicate and tender prince,  
Whose spirit with divine ambition puff'd  
Makes mouths at the invisible event,  
Exposing what is mortal and unsure  
To all that fortune, death and danger dare,  
Even for an egg-shell. Rightly to be great  
Is not to stir without great argument,  
But greatly to find quarrel in a straw  
When honor's at the stake. How stand I then,  
That have a father kill'd, a mother stain'd,  
Excitements of my reason and my blood,  
And let all sleep? while, to my shame, I see  
The imminent death of twenty thousand men,  
That, for a fantasy and trick of fame,  
Go to their graves like beds, fight for a plot  
Whereon the numbers cannot try the cause,  
Which is not tomb enough and continent  
To hide the slain? O, from this time forth,  
My thoughts be bloody, or be nothing worth!

*Exit*

### SCENE V. Elsinore. A room in the castle.

*Enter QUEEN GERTRUDE, HORATIO, and a Gentleman*

**QUEEN GERTRUDE**  
I will not speak with her.

**Gentleman**  
She is importunate, indeed distract:  
Her mood will needs be pitied.

**QUEEN GERTRUDE**  
What would she have?

**Gentleman**  
She speaks much of her father; says she hears  
There's tricks i' the world; and hems, and beats her heart;  
Spurns enviously at straws; her speech is nothing,  
Yet the unshaped use of it doth move  
The hearers to collection. /

**QUEEN GERTRUDE**  
/ Let her in.

*Exit HORATIO and Gentleman*

To my sick soul, as sin's true nature is,  
Each toy seems prologue to some great amiss:  
So full of artless jealousy is guilt,  
It spills itself in fearing to be spilt.

*Re-enter HORATIO, with OPHELIA*

**OPHELIA**  
Where is the beauteous majesty of Denmark?

**QUEEN GERTRUDE**  
How now, Ophelia!

**OPHELIA**  
*\[Sings]*  
He is dead and gone, lady,  
He is dead and gone;  
At his head a grass-green turf,  
At his heels a stone.  
White his shroud as the mountain snow,--

*Enter KING CLAUDIUS*

**QUEEN GERTRUDE**  
Alas, look here, my lord.

**OPHELIA**  
*\[Sings]*  
Larded with sweet flowers  
Which bewept to the grave did go  
With true-love showers.

**KING CLAUDIUS**  
How do you, pretty lady?

**OPHELIA**  
Well, God 'ild you! They say the owl was a baker's  
daughter. Lord, we know what we are, but know not  
what we may be. God be at your table!

**KING CLAUDIUS**  
Conceit upon her father.

**OPHELIA**  
Pray you, let's have no words of this; but when they  
ask you what it means, say you this:

*\[Sings]*  
Tomorrow is Saint Valentine's day,  
All in the morning betime,  
And I a maid at your window,  
To be your Valentine.  
Then up he rose, and donn'd his clothes,  
And dupp'd the chamber-door;  
Let in the maid, that out a maid  
Never departed more.

I hope all will be well. We must be patient: but I  
cannot choose but weep, to think they should lay him  
i' the cold ground. My brother shall know of it:  
and so I thank you for your good counsel. Come, my  
coach! Good night, ladies; good night, sweet ladies;  
good night, good night.

*Exit*

**KING CLAUDIUS**  
Follow her close; give her good watch,  
I pray you.

*Exit HORATIO*

O, this is the poison of deep grief; it springs  
All from her father's death. O Gertrude, Gertrude!

*A noise within*

**QUEEN GERTRUDE**  
Alack, what noise is this? /

**Gentleman**  
/ Save yourself, m'lord:  
The ocean, overpeering of his list,  
Eats not the flats with more impetuous haste  
Than young Laertes, in a riotous head,  
O'erbears your officers. The rabble call him lord;  
They cry 'Choose we: Laertes shall be king:'  
Caps, hands, and tongues, applaud it to the clouds:  
'Laertes shall be king, Laertes king!'

*Noise within*

*Enter LAERTES, armed; a Dane following*

**LAERTES**  
Where is this king? Sirs, stand you all without.  
Give me my father! /

**QUEEN GERTRUDE**  
/ Calmly, good Laertes.

**KING CLAUDIUS**  
What is the cause, Laertes,  
That thy rebellion looks so giant-like?  
Let him go, Gertrude; Tell me, Laertes,  
Why thou art thus incensed. Let him go.  
Speak, man.

**LAERTES**  
Where is my father? /

**KING CLAUDIUS**  
/ Dead.

**LAERTES**  
How came he dead? I'll not be juggled with:  
I dare damnation! To this point I stand,  
That both the worlds I give to negligence,  
Let come what comes; only I'll be revenged  
Most thoroughly for my father. /

**KING CLAUDIUS**  
/ Good Laertes,  
If you desire to know the certainty  
Of your dear father's death, is't writ in your revenge,  
That, swoopstake, you will draw both friend and foe,  
Winner and loser?

**LAERTES**  
None but his enemies. /

**KING CLAUDIUS**  
/ Will you know them then?

**LAERTES**  
To his good friends thus wide I'll ope my arms;  
And like the kind life-rendering pelican,  
Repast them with my blood. /

**KING CLAUDIUS**  
/ Why, now you speak  
Like a good child and a true gentleman.  
That I am guiltless of your father's death,  
And am most sensible in grief for it.

*Re-enter OPHELIA*

**LAERTES**  
O heat, dry up my brains! tears seven times salt,  
Burn out the sense and virtue of mine eye!  
By heaven, thy madness shall be paid by weight,  
Till our scale turn the beam. O rose of May!  
Dear maid, kind sister, sweet Ophelia!  
O heavens! is't possible, a young maid's wits  
Should be as moral as an old man's life?  
Nature is fine in love, and where 'tis fine,  
It sends some precious instance of itself  
After the thing it loves.

**OPHELIA**  
*\[Sings]*  
You must sing a-down a-down,  
An you call him a-down-a.

O, how the wheel becomes it! It is the false  
steward, that stole his master's daughter.

**LAERTES**  
This nothing's more than matter.

**OPHELIA**  
There's rosemary, that's for remembrance; pray,  
love, remember: and there is pansies. that's for thoughts.

**LAERTES**  
A document in madness, thoughts and remembrance fitted.

**OPHELIA**  
There's fennel for you, and columbines: there's rue  
for you; and here's some for me: we may call it  
herb-grace o' Sundays: O you must wear your rue with  
a difference. There's a daisy: I would give you  
some violets, but they withered all when my father  
died: they say he made a good end,--

*\[Sings]*  
For bonny sweet Robin is all my joy.  
And will he not come again?  
No, no, he is dead:  
Go to thy death-bed:  
He never will come again.  
His beard was as white as snow,  
He is gone, he is gone,  
And we cast away moan:  
God ha' mercy on his soul!

And of all Christian souls, I pray God. God be wi' ye.

*Exit*

**LAERTES**  
Do you see this, O God?

**KING CLAUDIUS**  
Laertes, I must commune with your grief,  
Make choice of whom your wisest friends you will.  
And they shall hear and judge 'twixt you and me:  
If by direct or by collateral hand  
They find us touch'd, we will our kingdom give,  
To you in satisfaction; but if not,  
Be you content to lend your patience to us,  
And we shall jointly labour with your soul  
To give it due content. /

**LAERTES**  
/ Let this be so;  
His means of death, his obscure funeral--  
No trophy, sword, nor hatchment o'er his bones,  
No noble rite nor formal ostentation--  
Cry to be heard, as 'twere from heaven to earth,  
That I must call't in question. /

**KING CLAUDIUS**  
/ So you shall;  
And where the offence is let the great axe fall.  
I pray you, go with me.

*Exeunt*

### SCENE VII. Another room in the castle.

*Enter KING CLAUDIUS and LAERTES*

**KING CLAUDIUS**  
Now must your conscience my acquaintance seal,  
Sith you have heard, and with a knowing ear,  
That he which hath your noble father slain  
Pursued my life. /

**LAERTES**  
/ It well appears: but tell me  
Why you proceeded not against these feats,  
So crimeful and so capital in nature,  
As by your safety, wisdom, all things else,  
You mainly were stirr'd up.

**KING CLAUDIUS**  
O, for two special reasons;  
Which may to you, perhaps, seem much unsinew'd,  
But yet to me they are strong. The queen his mother  
Lives almost by his looks; and for myself--  
She's so conjunctive to my life and soul,  
That, as the star moves not but in his sphere,  
I could not but by her. The other motive,  
Is the great love the general gender bear him;  
Who, dipping all his faults in their affection,  
Would, like the spring that turneth wood to stone,  
Convert his gyves to graces; so that my arrows  
Would have reverted to my bow again,  
And not where I had aim'd them.

**LAERTES**  
And so have I a noble father lost;  
A sister driven into desperate terms,  
Whose worth, if praises may go back again,  
Stood challenger on mount of all the age  
For her perfections: but my revenge will come.

*Enter a Messenger*

**KING CLAUDIUS**  
How now! what news? /

**Messenger**  
/ Letters, my lord, from Hamlet:  
This to your majesty; this to the queen.

**KING CLAUDIUS**  
Laertes, you shall hear them. Leave us.

*Exit Messenger*

*\[Reads]*  
'High and mighty, You shall know I am set naked on  
your kingdom. Tomorrow shall I beg leave to see  
your kingly eyes: when I shall, first asking your  
pardon thereunto, recount the occasion of my sudden  
and more strange return. 'HAMLET.'

What should this mean? Are all the rest come back?  
If it be so, Laertes, will you be ruled by me?  
If he be now return'd, I will work him  
To an exploit, now ripe in my device,  
Under the which he shall not choose but fall:  
And for his death no wind of blame shall breathe,  
But even his mother shall uncharge the practice  
And call it accident. /

**LAERTES**  
/ My lord, I will be ruled;  
The rather, if you could devise it so  
That I might be the organ. /

**KING CLAUDIUS**  
/ It falls right.  
Laertes, was your father dear to you?  
Not that I think you did not love your father;  
But that I know love is begun by time;  
Time qualifies the spark and fire of it.  
There lives within the very flame of love  
A kind of wick or snuff that will abate it.  
Hamlet comes back: what would you undertake,  
To show yourself your father's son in deed  
More than in words? /

**LAERTES**  
/ To cut his throat i' the church.

**KING CLAUDIUS**  
No place, indeed, should murder sanctuarize;  
Revenge should have no bounds. But, good Laertes,  
Will you do this, keep close within your chamber.  
Hamlet return'd shall know you are come home:  
We'll put on those shall praise your excellence  
And set a double varnish on the fame  
The Frenchman gave you, bring you in fine together  
And wager on your heads: he, being remiss,  
Most generous and free from all contriving,  
Will not peruse the foils; so that, with ease,  
Or with a little shuffling, you may choose  
A sword unbated, and in a pass of practice  
Requite him for your father. /

**LAERTES**  
/ I will do't:  
And, for that purpose, I'll anoint my sword.  
I bought an unction of a mountebank,  
So mortal that, but dip a knife in it,  
Where it draws blood no cataplasm so rare,  
Collected from all simples that have virtue  
Under the moon, can save the thing from death  
That is but scratch'd withal: I'll touch my point  
With this contagion, that, if I gall him slightly,  
It may be death. /

**KING CLAUDIUS**  
/ Let's further think of this;  
Weigh what convenience both of time and means  
May fit us to our shape: if this should fail,  
'Twere better not assay'd: therefore this project  
Should have a back or second, that might hold,  
If this should blast in proof. Soft! let me see:  
When in your motion you are hot and dry--  
And that he calls for drink, I'll have prepared him  
A chalice for the nonce, whereon but sipping,  
If he by chance escape your venom'd stuck,  
Our purpose may hold there. /

*Enter QUEEN GERTRUDE*

/ How now, sweet queen!

**QUEEN GERTRUDE**  
One woe doth tread upon another's heel,  
So fast they follow; your sister's drown'd, Laertes.

**LAERTES**  
Drown'd! O, where?

**QUEEN GERTRUDE**  
There is a willow grows aslant a brook,  
That shows his hoar leaves in the glassy stream;  
There with fantastic garlands did she come  
Of crow-flowers, nettles, daisies, and long purples  
That liberal shepherds give a grosser name,  
But our cold maids do dead men's fingers call them:  
There, on the pendent boughs her coronet weeds  
Clambering to hang, an envious sliver broke;  
When down her weedy trophies and herself  
Fell in the weeping brook. Her clothes spread wide;  
And, mermaid-like, awhile they bore her up:  
Which time she chanted snatches of old tunes;  
As one incapable of her own distress,  
Or like a creature native and indued  
Unto that element: but long it could not be  
Till that her garments, heavy with their drink,  
Pull'd the poor wretch from her melodious lay  
To muddy death. /

**LAERTES**  
/ Alas, then, she is drown'd?

**QUEEN GERTRUDE**  
Drown'd, drown'd.

**LAERTES**  
Too much of water hast thou, poor Ophelia,  
And therefore I forbid my tears: but yet  
It is our trick; nature her custom holds,  
Let shame say what it will: when these are gone,  
The woman will be out. Adieu, my lord:  
I have a speech of fire, that fain would blaze,  
But that this folly douts it.

*Exeunt*

## ACT V

### SCENE I. A churchyard.

*Enter two Clowns, with spades, & c*

**First Clown**  
Why, there thou say'st: and the more pity that  
great folk should have countenance in this world to  
drown or hang themselves, more than their even  
Christian. Come, my spade. There is no ancient  
gentleman but gardeners, ditchers, and grave-makers:  
they hold up Adam's profession.

**Second Clown**  
Was he a gentleman?

**First Clown**  
He was the first that ever bore arms.

**Second Clown**  
Why, he had none.

**First Clown**  
What, art a heathen? How dost thou understand the  
Scripture? The Scripture says 'Adam digged:'  
could he dig without arms? I'll put another  
question to thee: if thou answerest me not to the  
purpose, confess thyself--

**Second Clown**  
Go to.

**First Clown**  
What is he that builds stronger than either the  
mason, the shipwright, or the carpenter?

**Second Clown**  
The gallows-maker; for that frame outlives a  
thousand tenants.

**First Clown**  
I like thy wit well, in good faith: the gallows  
does well; but how does it well? it does well to  
those that do in: now thou dost ill to say the  
gallows is built stronger than the church: argal,  
the gallows may do well to thee. To't again, come.

**Second Clown**  
'Who builds stronger than a mason, a shipwright, or  
a carpenter?'

**First Clown**  
Ay, tell me that, and unyoke.

**Second Clown**  
Marry, now I can tell.

**First Clown**  
To't.

**Second Clown**  
Mass, I cannot tell.

*Enter HAMLET and HORATIO, at a distance*

**First Clown**  
Cudgel thy brains no more about it, for your dull  
ass will not mend his pace with beating; and, when  
you are asked this question next, say 'a  
grave-maker: 'the houses that he makes last till  
doomsday. Go, get thee to Yaughan: fetch me a  
stoup of liquor.

*Exit Second Clown*

*\[He digs and sings]*

**HAMLET**  
Has this fellow no feeling of his business, that he  
sings at grave-making?

*The Clown throws up a skull*

That skull had a tongue in it, and could sing once:  
how the knave jowls it to the ground, as if it were  
Cain's jaw-bone, that did the first murder! It  
might be the pate of a politician, which this ass  
now o'er-reaches;  
Or of a courtier; which could say 'Good morrow,  
sweet lord! How dost thou, good lord?'

*Throws up another skull*

There's another: why does he suffer this rude knave now  
to knock him about the sconce with a dirty shovel, and  
will not tell him of his action of battery? Whose grave's  
this, sirrah?

**First Clown**  
Mine, sir.

*\[Sings]*  
O, a pit of clay for to be made  
For such a guest is meet.

**HAMLET**  
I think it be thine, indeed; for thou liest in't.

**First Clown**  
You lie out on't, sir, and therefore it is not  
yours: for my part, I do not lie in't, and yet it is mine.

**HAMLET**  
'Thou dost lie in't, to be in't and say it is thine:  
'tis for the dead, not for the quick; therefore thou liest.

**First Clown**  
'Tis a quick lie, sir; 'twill away gain, from me to you.

**HAMLET**  
What man dost thou dig it for?

**First Clown**  
For no man, sir.

**HAMLET**  
What woman, then?

**First Clown**  
For none, neither.

**HAMLET**  
Who is to be buried in't?

**First Clown**  
One that was a woman, sir; but, rest her soul, she's dead.

**HAMLET**  
How absolute the knave is! we must speak by the  
card, or equivocation will undo us. By the Lord,  
Horatio, these three years I have taken a note of  
it; the age is grown so picked that the toe of the  
peasant comes so near the heel of the courtier, he  
gaffs his kibe. How long hast thou been a  
grave-maker?

**First Clown**  
Of all the days i' the year, I came to't that day  
that our last king Hamlet overcame Fortinbras. It  
was the very day that young Hamlet was born; he that  
is mad, and sent into England.

**HAMLET**  
Ay, marry, why was he sent into England?

**First Clown**  
Why, because he was mad: he shall recover his wits  
there; or, if he do not, it's no great matter there.

**HAMLET**  
How long will a man lie i' the earth ere he rot?

**First Clown**  
I' faith, if he be not rotten before he die-as we  
have many pocky corses now-a-days, that will scarce  
hold the laying in-he will last you some eight year  
or nine year: a tanner will last you nine year.

**HAMLET**  
Why he more than another?

**First Clown**  
Why, sir, his hide is so tanned with his trade, that  
he will keep out water a great while; and your water  
is a sore decayer of your whoreson dead body.  
Here's a skull now; this skull has lain in the earth  
three and twenty years. This same skull,  
sir, was Yorick's skull, the king's jester.

**HAMLET**  
Let me see.

*\[Takes the skull]*  
Alas, poor Yorick! I knew him, Horatio: a fellow  
of infinite jest, of most excellent fancy: he hath  
borne me on his back a thousand times; and now, how  
abhorred in my imagination it is! my gorge rims at  
it. Here hung those lips that I have kissed I know  
not how oft. Where be your gibes now? your  
gambols? your songs? your flashes of merriment,  
that were wont to set the table on a roar? Not one  
now, to mock your own grinning? quite chap-fallen?  
Now get you to my lady's chamber, and tell her, let  
her paint an inch thick, to this favour she must  
come; make her laugh at that. Prithee, Horatio, tell  
me one thing.

*\[Puts down the skull]*

But soft! but soft! aside: here comes the king.

*Enter Priest, & c. in procession; the Corpse of OPHELIA, LAERTES, KING
CLAUDIUS, and QUEEN GERTRUDE*

The queen, the courtiers: who is this they follow?  
The corse they follow did with desperate hand  
Fordo its own life: 'twas of some estate.  
*\[Retiring with HORATIO]*

**LAERTES**  
What ceremony else?

**Priest**  
Her obsequies have been as far enlarged  
As we have warrantise: her death was doubtful;  
She should in ground unsanctified have lodged  
Till the last trumpet: for charitable prayers,  
Shards, flints and pebbles should be thrown on her;  
Yet here she is allow'd her virgin crants,  
Her maiden strewments and the bringing home  
Of bell and burial. /

**LAERTES**  
/ Lay her i' the earth:  
And from her fair and unpolluted flesh  
May violets spring! I tell thee, churlish priest,  
A ministering angel shall my sister be,  
When thou liest howling. /

**HAMLET**  
/ What, the fair Ophelia!

**QUEEN GERTRUDE**  
Sweets to the sweet: farewell!

*\[Scattering flowers]*  
I hoped thou shouldst have been my Hamlet's wife;  
I thought thy bride-bed to have deck'd, sweet maid,  
And not have strew'd thy grave. /

**LAERTES**  
/ O, treble woe  
Fall ten times treble on that cursed head,  
Whose wicked deed thy most ingenious sense  
Deprived thee of! Hold off the earth awhile,  
Till I have caught her once more in mine arms:

*\[Leaps into the grave]*  
Now pile your dust upon the quick and dead,  
Till of this flat a mountain you have made,  
To o'ertop old Pelion, or the skyish head  
Of blue Olympus. /

**HAMLET**  
*\[Advancing]*  
/ What is he whose grief  
Bears such an emphasis? whose phrase of sorrow  
Conjures the wandering stars, and makes them stand  
Like wonder-wounded hearers? This is I,  
Hamlet the Dane.  
*\[Leaps into the grave]*

**LAERTES**  
The devil take thy soul! /  
*\[Grappling with him]*

**HAMLET**  
/ Thou pray'st not well.  
I prithee, take thy fingers from my throat!

*Horatio parts them, and they come out of the grave*

Why I will fight with him upon this theme  
Until my eyelids will no longer wag.

**QUEEN GERTRUDE**  
O my son, what theme?

**HAMLET**  
I loved Ophelia: forty thousand brothers  
Could not, with all their quantity of love,  
Make up my sum. What wilt thou do for her?  
Woo't weep? woo't fight? woo't fast? woo't tear thyself?  
I'll do't. Dost thou come here to whine?  
To outface me with leaping in her grave?  
Be buried quick with her, and so will I:  
I'll rant as well as thou. /

**QUEEN GERTRUDE**  
/ This is mere madness:  
And thus awhile the fit will work on him;  
Anon, as patient as the female dove,  
When that her golden couplets are disclosed,  
His silence will sit drooping. /

**HAMLET**  
/ Hear you, sir;  
What is the reason that you use me thus?  
I loved you ever: but it is no matter;  
Let Hercules himself do what he may,  
The cat will mew and dog will have his day.

*Exit*

**KING CLAUDIUS**  
*\[To LAERTES]*  
Strengthen your patience in our last night's speech;  
We'll put the matter to the present push.  
Good Gertrude, set some watch over your son.  
This grave shall have a living monument:  
An hour of quiet shortly shall we see;  
Till then, in patience our proceeding be.

*Exeunt*

### SCENE II. A hall in the castle.

*Enter HAMLET and HORATIO*

**HAMLET**  
Does it not, think'st thee, stand me now upon--  
He that hath kill'd my king and whored my mother,  
Popp'd in between the election and my hopes,  
Thrown out his angle for my proper life,  
And with such cozenage-is't not perfect conscience,  
To quit him with this arm?

**HORATIO**  
It must be shortly known to him from England  
What is the issue of the business there.

**HAMLET**  
It will be short: the interim is mine;  
But I am very sorry, good Horatio,  
That to Laertes I forgot myself;  
For, by the image of my cause, I see  
The portraiture of his: I'll court his favors.  
But, sure, the bravery of his grief did put me  
Into a towering passion. /

**HORATIO**  
/ Peace! who comes here?

*Enter OSRIC*

**OSRIC**  
Your lordship is right welcome back to Denmark.

**HAMLET**  
I humbly thank you, sir. Dost know this water-fly?

**HORATIO**  
No, my good lord.

**HAMLET**  
Thy state is the more gracious; for 'tis a vice to  
know him. He hath much land, and fertile: let a  
beast be lord of beasts, and his crib shall stand at  
the king's mess: 'tis a chough; but, as I say,  
spacious in the possession of dirt.

**OSRIC**  
Sweet lord, if your lordship were at leisure, I  
should impart a thing to you from his majesty.

**HAMLET**  
I will receive it, sir, with all diligence of  
spirit. Put your bonnet to his right use; 'tis for the head.

**OSRIC**  
I thank your lordship, it is very hot.

**HAMLET**  
No, believe me, 'tis very cold; the wind is  
northerly.

**OSRIC**  
It is indifferent cold, my lord, indeed.

**HAMLET**  
But yet methinks it is very sultry and hot for my  
complexion.

**OSRIC**  
Exceedingly, my lord; it is very sultry,--as  
'twere,--I cannot tell how. But, my lord, his  
majesty bade me signify to you that he has laid a  
great wager on your head: sir, this is the matter,--

**HAMLET**  
I beseech you, remember--

*HAMLET moves him to put on his hat*

**OSRIC**  
Nay, good my lord; for mine ease, in good faith.  
Sir, here is newly come to court Laertes; believe  
me, an absolute gentleman, full of most excellent  
differences, of very soft society and great showing:  
indeed, to speak feelingly of him, he is the card or  
calendar of gentry, for you shall find in him the  
continent of what part a gentleman would see.

**HAMLET**  
Sir, his definement suffers no perdition in you;  
though, I know, to divide him inventorially would  
dizzy the arithmetic of memory, and yet but yaw  
neither, in respect of his quick sail. But, in the  
verity of extolment, I take him to be a soul of  
great article; and his infusion of such dearth and  
rareness, as, to make true diction of him, his  
semblable is his mirror; and who else would trace  
him, his umbrage, nothing more.

**OSRIC**  
Your lordship speaks most infallibly of him.

**HAMLET**  
What imports the nomination of this gentleman?

**OSRIC**  
Of Laertes?

**HORATIO**  
His purse is empty already; all's golden words are spent.

**HAMLET**  
Of him, sir.

**OSRIC**  
I know you are not ignorant--

**HAMLET**  
I would you did, sir; yet, in faith, if you did,  
it would not much approve me. Well, sir?

**OSRIC**  
You are not ignorant of what excellence Laertes is--

**HAMLET**  
I dare not confess that, lest I should compare with  
him in excellence; but, to know a man well, were to  
know himself.

**OSRIC**  
I mean, sir, for his weapon; but in the imputation  
laid on him by them, in his meed he's unfellowed.

**HAMLET**  
What's his weapon?

**OSRIC**  
Rapier and dagger.

**HAMLET**  
That's two of his weapons: but, well.

**OSRIC**  
The king, sir, hath wagered with him six Barbary  
horses: against the which he has imponed, as I take  
it, six French rapiers and poniards, with their  
assigns, as girdle, hangers, and so: three of the  
carriages, in faith, are very dear to fancy, very  
responsive to the hilts, most delicate carriages,  
and of very liberal conceit.

**HAMLET**  
What call you the carriages?

**HORATIO**  
I knew you must be edified by the margent ere you had done.

**OSRIC**  
The carriages, sir, are the hangers.

**HAMLET**  
The phrase would be more german to the matter, if we  
could carry cannon by our sides: I would it might  
be hangers till then. But, on: six Barbary horses  
against six French swords, their assigns, and three  
liberal-conceited carriages; that's the French bet  
against the Danish. Why is this 'imponed,' as you call it?

**OSRIC**  
The king, sir, hath laid, that in a dozen passes  
between yourself and him, he shall not exceed you  
three hits: he hath laid on twelve for nine; and it  
would come to immediate trial, if your lordship  
would vouchsafe the answer.

**HAMLET**  
How if I answer 'no'?

**OSRIC**  
I mean, my lord, the opposition of your person in trial.

**HAMLET**  
Sir, I will walk here in the hall: if it please his  
majesty, 'tis the breathing time of day with me; let  
the foils be brought, the gentleman willing, and the  
king hold his purpose, I will win for him an I can;  
if not, I will gain nothing but my shame and the odd hits.

**OSRIC**  
Shall I re-deliver you e'en so?

**HAMLET**  
To this effect, sir; after what flourish your nature will.

**OSRIC**  
I commend my duty to your lordship.

**HAMLET**  
Yours, yours.

*Exit OSRIC*

He does well to commend it himself; there are no  
tongues else for's turn.

**HORATIO**  
This lapwing runs away with the shell on his head.

**HAMLET**  
He did comply with his dug, before he sucked it.  
Thus has he--and many more of the same bevy that I  
know the dressy age dotes on--only got the tune of  
the time and outward habit of encounter; a kind of  
yesty collection, which carries them through and  
through the most fond and winnowed opinions; and do  
but blow them to their trial, the bubbles are out.

*Enter a Lord*

**Lord**  
My lord, his majesty commended him to you by young  
Osric, who brings back to him that you attend him in  
the hall: he sends to know if your pleasure hold to  
play with Laertes, or that you will take longer time.

**HAMLET**  
I am constant to my purpose; they follow the king's  
pleasure: if his fitness speaks, mine is ready; now  
or whensoever, provided I be so able as now.

*Exit Lord*

**HORATIO**  
You will lose this wager, my lord.

**HAMLET**  
I do not think so: since he went into France, I  
have been in continual practice: I shall win at the  
odds.

**HORATIO**  
Nay, good my lord,--

**HAMLET**  
It is but foolery; but it is such a kind of  
gain-giving, as would perhaps trouble a woman.

**HORATIO**  
If your mind dislike anything, obey it: I will  
forestall their repair hither, and say you are not  
fit.

**HAMLET**  
Not a whit, we defy augury: there's a special  
providence in the fall of a sparrow. If it be now,  
'tis not to come; if it be not to come, it will be  
now; if it be not now, yet it will come: the  
readiness is all: since no man has aught of what he  
leaves, what is't to leave betimes?

*Enter KING CLAUDIUS, QUEEN GERTRUDE, LAERTES, and OSRIC with foils.*

**KING CLAUDIUS**  
Come, Hamlet, come, and take this hand from me.

*KING CLAUDIUS puts LAERTES' hand into HAMLET's*

**HAMLET**  
Give me your pardon, sir: I've done you wrong;  
This presence knows,  
And you must needs have heard, how I am punish'd  
With sore distraction. What I have done,  
I here proclaim was madness.  
Was't Hamlet wrong'd Laertes? Never Hamlet:  
Who does it, then? His madness: if't be so.  
Let my disclaiming from a purposed evil  
Free me so far in your most generous thoughts,  
That I have shot mine arrow o'er the house,  
And hurt my brother. /

**LAERTES**  
/ I am satisfied in nature,  
Whose motive, in this case, should stir me most  
To my revenge: but in my terms of honor  
I stand aloof; and will no reconcilement,  
Till by some elder masters, of known honor,  
I have a voice and precedent of peace,  
To keep my name ungored. But till that time,  
I do receive your offer'd love like love,  
And will not wrong it.

**KING CLAUDIUS**  
Give them the foils, young Osric. Cousin Hamlet,  
You know the wager? /

**HAMLET**  
/ Very well, my lord  
Your grace hath laid the odds o' the weaker side.

**KING CLAUDIUS**  
I do not fear it; I have seen you both:  
But since he is better'd, we have therefore odds.

*They prepare to play*

**HAMLET**  
Come on, sir. /

**LAERTES**  
/ Come, my lord. /

*They play*

**HAMLET**  
/ One. /

**LAERTES**  
/ No. /

**HAMLET**  
/ Judgment.

**OSRIC**  
A hit, a very palpable hit. /

**LAERTES**  
/ Well; again.

**KING CLAUDIUS**  
Stay; give me drink. Hamlet, this pearl is thine;  
Here's to thy health. /

*Trumpets sound, and cannon shot off within*

/ Give him the cup.

**HAMLET**  
I'll play this bout first; set it by awhile. Come.

*They play*

Another hit; what say you?

**LAERTES**  
A touch, a touch, I do confess.

**KING CLAUDIUS**  
Our son shall win. /

**QUEEN GERTRUDE**  
/ He's fat, and scant of breath.  
Here, Hamlet, take my napkin, rub thy brows;  
The queen carouses to thy fortune, Hamlet.

**HAMLET**  
Good madam!

**KING CLAUDIUS**  
Gertrude, do not drink.

**QUEEN GERTRUDE**  
I will, my lord; I pray you, pardon me.

**KING CLAUDIUS**  
*\[Aside]*  
It is the poison'd cup: it is too late.

**HAMLET**  
I dare not drink yet, madam; by and by.

**QUEEN GERTRUDE**  
Come, let me wipe thy face.

**HAMLET**  
Come, for the third, Laertes: you but dally;  
I pray you, pass with your best violence;

*They play*

**OSRIC**  
Nothing, neither way. /

**LAERTES**  
/ Have at you now!

*LAERTES wounds HAMLET; then in scuffling, they change rapiers, and
HAMLET wounds LAERTES*

**KING CLAUDIUS**  
Part them; they are incensed. /

**HAMLET**  
/ Nay, come, again.

*QUEEN GERTRUDE falls*

**OSRIC**  
Look to the queen there, ho!

**HORATIO**  
They bleed on both sides. How is it, my lord?

**OSRIC**  
How is't, Laertes?

**LAERTES**  
Why, as a woodcock to mine own springe, Osric;  
I am justly kill'd with mine own treachery.

**HAMLET**  
How does the queen? /

**KING CLAUDIUS**  
/ She swounds to see them bleed.

**QUEEN GERTRUDE**  
No, no, the drink, the drink,--O my dear Hamlet,--  
The drink, the drink! I am poison'd.  
*\[Dies]*

**HAMLET**  
O villany! Ho! let the door be lock'd:  
Treachery! Seek it out.

**LAERTES**  
It is here, Hamlet: Hamlet, thou art slain;  
No medicine in the world can do thee good;  
In thee there is not half an hour of life;  
The treacherous instrument is in thy hand,  
Unbated and envenom'd: the foul practice  
Hath turn'd itself on me lo, here I lie,  
Never to rise again: thy mother's poison'd:  
I can no more: the king, the king's to blame.

**HAMLET**  
The point!--envenom'd too!  
Then, venom, to thy work.  
*\[Stabs KING CLAUDIUS]*

**KING CLAUDIUS**  
O, yet defend me, friends; I am but hurt.

**HAMLET**  
Here, thou incestuous, murderous, damned Dane,  
Drink off this potion. Is thy union here?  
Follow my mother. /

*KING CLAUDIUS dies*

**LAERTES**  
/ He is justly served;  
It is a poison temper'd by himself.  
Exchange forgiveness with me, noble Hamlet:  
Mine and my father's death come not upon thee,  
Nor thine on me.  
*\[Dies]*

**HAMLET**  
Heaven make thee free of it! I follow thee.  
I am dead, Horatio. Wretched queen, adieu!  
But let it be. Horatio, I am dead;  
Thou livest; report me and my cause aright  
To the unsatisfied. /

**HORATIO**  
/ Never believe it:  
I am more an antique Roman than a Dane:  
Here's yet some liquor left. /

**HAMLET**  
/ As thou'rt a man,  
Give me the cup: let go; by heaven, I'll have't.  
O good Horatio, what a wounded name!  
If thou didst ever hold me in thy heart  
Absent thee from felicity awhile,  
And in this harsh world draw thy breath in pain,  
To tell my story. /

*March afar off, and shot within*

/ What warlike noise is this?

**OSRIC**  
Young Fortinbras, with conquest come from Poland,  
To the ambassadors of England gives  
This warlike volley. /

**HAMLET**  
/ O, I die, Horatio;  
The potent poison quite o'er-crows my spirit:  
I cannot live to hear the news from England;  
But I do prophesy the election lights  
On Fortinbras: he has my dying voice;  
So tell him, with the occurrents, more and less,  
Which have solicited. The rest is silence.  
*\[Dies]*

**HORATIO**  
Now cracks a noble heart. Good night sweet prince:  
And flights of angels sing thee to thy rest!  
Why does the drum come hither?

*March within*

*Enter FORTINBRAS, the English Ambassador, and soldiers*

**PRINCE FORTINBRAS**  
This quarry cries on havoc. O proud death,  
What feast is toward in thine eternal cell,  
That thou so many princes at a shot  
So bloodily hast struck? /

**English Ambassador**  
/ The sight is dismal;  
And our affairs from England come too late:  
The ears are senseless that should give us hearing,  
To tell him his commandment is fulfill'd,  
That Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are dead:  
Where should we have our thanks? /

**HORATIO**  
/ Not from his mouth,  
Had it the ability of life to thank you:  
He never gave commandment for their death.  
You from the Polack wars, and you from England,  
Are here arrived give order that these bodies  
High on a stage be placed to the view;  
And let me speak to the yet unknowing world  
How these things came about: so shall you hear  
Of carnal, bloody, and unnatural acts,  
Of accidental judgments, casual slaughters,  
Of deaths put on by cunning and forced cause,  
And, in this upshot, purposes mistook  
Fall'n on the inventors' reads: all this can I  
Truly deliver. /

**PRINCE FORTINBRAS**  
/ Let four captains  
Bear Hamlet, like a soldier, to the stage;  
For he was likely, had he been put on,  
To have proved most royally: and, for his passage,  
The soldiers' music and the rites of war  
Speak loudly for him.  
Take up the bodies: such a sight as this  
Becomes the field, but here shows much amiss.  
Go, bid the soldiers shoot.

*A dead march. Exeunt, bearing off the dead bodies; after which a peal of
ordnance is shot off*

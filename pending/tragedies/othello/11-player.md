## ACT I

### SCENE I. Venice. A street.

*Enter RODERIGO and IAGO*

**RODERIGO**  
Thou told'st me thou didst hold him in thy hate.

**IAGO**  
Despise me, if I do not. Three great ones of the city,  
In personal suit to make me his lieutenant,  
Off-capp'd to him: and, by the faith of man,  
I know my price, I am worth no worse a place:  
But he; as loving his own pride and purposes,  
Evades them, with a bombast circumstance  
Horribly stuff'd with epithets of war;  
Nonsuits my mediators; for, 'Certes,' says he,  
'I have already chose my officer.'  
One Michael Cassio, a Florentine,  
That never set a squadron in the field;  
And I, of whom his eyes had seen the proof  
At Rhodes, at Cyprus and on other grounds  
Christian and heathen, must be be-lee'd and calm'd  
By debitor and creditor: this counter-caster,  
He, in good time, must his lieutenant be,  
And I--God bless the mark!--his Moorship's ancient.

**RODERIGO**  
I would not follow him then. /

**IAGO**  
/ O, sir, content you;  
I follow him to serve my turn upon him:  
Many a duteous and knee-crooking knave,  
That wears out his time, much like his master's ass,  
For nought but provender, and when he's old, cashier'd:  
Whip me such honest knaves. Others there are  
Who, trimm'd in forms and visages of duty,  
Keep yet their hearts attending on themselves,  
Do well thrive by them and when they have lined their coats  
Do themselves homage: these fellows have some soul;  
Were I the Moor, I would not be Iago:  
In following him, I follow but myself;  
Heaven is my judge, not I for love and duty,  
But seeming so, for my peculiar end:  
But I will wear my heart upon my sleeve  
For daws to peck at: I am not what I am.

**RODERIGO**  
What a full fortune does the thicklips owe  
If he can carry't thus! /

**IAGO**  
/ Call up her father,  
Proclaim him in the streets; incense her kinsmen,  
Plague him with flies: though that his joy be joy,  
Yet throw such changes of vexation on't,  
As it may lose some colour.

**RODERIGO**  
What, ho, Brabantio! Signior Brabantio, ho!

**IAGO**  
Awake! what, ho, Brabantio! thieves! thieves! thieves!

*BRABANTIO appears above, at a window*

**BRABANTIO**  
What is the reason of this terrible summons?

**RODERIGO**  
Signior, is all your family within?

**BRABANTIO**  
Why, wherefore ask you this?

**IAGO**  
'Zounds, sir, you're robb'd; for shame, put on your gown;  
Your heart is burst, you have lost half your soul;  
Even now, now, very now, an old black ram  
Is topping your white ewe. Arise, arise;  
Or else the devil will make a grandsire of you:
Arise, I say. /

**BRABANTIO**  
/ What, have you lost your wits?

**RODERIGO**  
Most reverend signior, do you know my voice?

**BRABANTIO**  
Not I what are you?

**RODERIGO**  
My name is Roderigo. /

**BRABANTIO**  
/ The worser welcome:  
I have charged thee not to haunt about my doors:  
In honest plainness thou hast heard me say  
My daughter is not for thee; and now, in madness,  
Being full of supper and distempering draughts,  
Upon malicious bravery, dost thou come  
To start my quiet. /

**RODERIGO**  
/ Sir, sir, sir,--

**BRABANTIO**  
What tell'st thou me of robbing? this is Venice;  
My house is not a grange. /

**RODERIGO**  
/ Most grave Brabantio,  
In simple and pure soul I come to you.

**IAGO**  
'Zounds, sir, you are one of those that will not  
serve God, if the devil bid you. Because we come to  
do you service and you think we are ruffians, you'll  
have your daughter covered with a Barbary horse.

**BRABANTIO**  
What profane wretch art thou?

**IAGO**  
I am one, sir, that comes to tell you your daughter  
and the Moor are now making the beast with two backs.

**BRABANTIO**  
Thou art a villain. /

**IAGO**  
/ You are--a senator.

**BRABANTIO**  
This thou shalt answer; I know thee, Roderigo.

**RODERIGO**  
Sir, I will answer anything. But, I beseech you,  
If't be your pleasure and most wise consent,  
As partly I find it is, that your fair daughter,  
Transported, with no worse nor better guard  
But with a knave of common hire, a gondolier,  
To the gross clasps of a lascivious Moor--  
If this be known to you and your allowance,  
We then have done you bold and saucy wrongs;  
But if you know not this, my manners tell me  
We have your wrong rebuke. Do not believe  
If she be in her chamber or your house,  
Let loose on me the justice of the state  
For thus deluding you. /

**BRABANTIO**  
/ Strike on the tinder, ho!  
Give me a taper! call up all my people!

*Exit above*

**IAGO**  
Farewell; for I must leave you:  
It seems not meet, nor wholesome to my place,  
To be produced--as, if I stay, I shall--  
Against the Moor:  
Though I do hate him as I do hell-pains.  
Yet, for necessity of present life,  
I must show out a flag and sign of love,  
Which is indeed but sign. So, farewell.

*Exit*

*Enter, below, BRABANTIO*

**BRABANTIO**  
It is too true an evil: gone she is;  
Where didst thou see her? O unhappy girl!  
With the Moor, say'st thou? Who would be a father!  
How didst thou know 'twas she? O she deceives me  
Past thought! What said she to you? Get more tapers:  
Raise all my kindred. Are they married, think you?

**RODERIGO**  
Truly, I think they are.

**BRABANTIO**  
O heaven! How got she out? O treason of the blood!  
Fathers, from hence trust not your daughters' minds  
By what you see them act. Is there not charms  
By which the property of youth and maidhood  
May be abused?  
Call up my brother. Do you know  
Where we may apprehend her and the Moor?

**RODERIGO**  
I think I can discover him, if you please,  
To get good guard and go along with me.

**BRABANTIO**  
Pray you, lead on. At every house I'll call;  
I may command at most. Get weapons, ho!

*Exeunt*

### SCENE II. Another street.

*Enter OTHELLO and IAGO*

**IAGO**  
Though in the trade of war I have slain men,  
Yet do I hold it very stuff o' the conscience  
To do no contrived murder: I lack iniquity  
Sometimes to do me service: nine or ten times  
I had thought to have yerk'd him here under the ribs.

**OTHELLO**  
'Tis better as it is. /

**IAGO**  
/ Nay, but he prated,  
And spoke such scurvy and provoking terms  
Against your honour  
That, with the little godliness I have,  
I did full hard forbear him. But, I pray you, sir,  
Are you fast married? Be assured of this,  
That the magnifico is much beloved,  
And hath in his effect a voice potential  
As double as the duke's /

**OTHELLO**  
/ Let him do his spite:  
My services which I have done the signiory  
Shall out-tongue his complaints. For know, Iago,  
But that I love the gentle Desdemona,  
I would not my unhoused free condition  
Put into circumscription and confine  
For the sea's worth. But, look! what lights come yond?

**IAGO**  
Those are the raised father and his friends:  
You were best go in. /

**OTHELLO**  
/ Not I, I must be found.

*Enter CASSIO*

**OTHELLO**  
The servant of the duke, and my lieutenant.  
What is the news? /

**CASSIO**  
/ The duke does greet you, general,  
And he requires your haste-post-haste appearance,  
Even on the instant. /

**OTHELLO**  
/ What is the matter, think you?

**CASSIO**  
Something from Cyprus as I may divine:  
It is a business of some heat: the galleys  
Have sent a dozen sequent messengers  
This very night at one another's heels,  
To search you out. /

**OTHELLO**  
/ 'Tis well I am found by you.  
I will but spend a word here in the house,  
And go with you. /

*Exit*

**CASSIO**  
/ Ancient, what makes he here?

**IAGO**  
'Faith, he tonight hath boarded a land carack:  
If it prove lawful prize, he's made forever.

**CASSIO**  
I do not understand. /

**IAGO**  
/ He's married. /

**CASSIO**  
/ To who?

*Re-enter OTHELLO*

**IAGO**  
Marry, to--Come, captain, will you go?

**OTHELLO**  
Have with you.

**CASSIO**  
Here comes another troop to seek for you.

**IAGO**  
It is Brabantio. General, be advised;  
He comes to bad intent. /

*Enter BRABANTIO, RODERIGO, and an Officer with torch and weapons*

**BRABANTIO**  
/ Down with him, thief!

*They draw on both sides*

**IAGO**  
You, Roderigo! come, sir, I am for you.

**OTHELLO**  
Good signior, you shall more command with years  
Than with your weapons.

**BRABANTIO**  
O thou foul thief, where hast thou stow'd my daughter?  
If she in chains of magic were not bound,  
Whether a maid so tender, fair and happy,  
So opposite to marriage that she shunned  
The wealthy curled darlings of our nation,  
Would ever have, to incur a general mock,  
Run from her guardage to the sooty bosom  
Of such a thing as thou, to fear, not to delight.  
Judge me the world, if 'tis not gross in sense  
That thou hast practised on her with foul charms,  
Abused her delicate youth with drugs or minerals  
That weaken motion:  
Lay hold upon him: if he do resist,  
Subdue him at his peril. /

**OTHELLO**  
/ Where will you that I go  
To answer this your charge? /

**BRABANTIO**  
/ To prison, till fit time  
Of law and course of direct session  
Call thee to answer. /

**OTHELLO**  
/ What if I do obey?  
How may the duke be therewith satisfied,  
Whose messengers are here about my side,  
Upon some present business of the state  
To bring me to him? /

**CASSIO**  
/ 'Tis true, most worthy signior;  
The duke's in council and your noble self,  
I am sure, is sent for. /

**BRABANTIO**  
/ How! the duke in council!  
In this time of the night! Bring him away:  
Mine's not an idle cause: the duke himself,  
Or any of my brothers of the state,  
Cannot but feel this wrong as 'twere their own;  
For if such actions may have passage free,  
Bond-slaves and pagans shall our statesmen be.

*Exeunt*

### SCENE III. A council-chamber.

*The DUKE and Senators sitting at a table; Officers attending*

**DUKE OF VENICE**  
There is no composition in these news  
That gives them credit.

**First Senator**  
Indeed, they are disproportion'd;  
My letters say a hundred and seven galleys.

**DUKE OF VENICE**  
And mine, a hundred and forty. /

**Second Senator**  
/ And mine, two hundred:  
But though they jump not on a just account,--  
As in these cases, where the aim reports,  
'Tis oft with difference--yet do they all confirm  
A Turkish fleet, and bearing up to Cyprus.

**DUKE OF VENICE**  
Nay, it is possible enough to judgment:  
I do not so secure me in the error,  
But the main article I do approve  
In fearful sense. /

**Sailor**  
*\[Within]*  
/ What, ho! what, ho! what, ho!

*Enter a Sailor*

**DUKE OF VENICE**  
Now, what's the business?

**Sailor**  
The Turkish preparation makes for Rhodes;  
So was I bid report here to the state  
By Signior Angelo. /

**First Senator**  
/ This cannot be,  
By no assay of reason: 'tis a pageant,  
To keep us in false gaze. When we consider  
The importancy of Cyprus to the Turk,  
And let ourselves again but understand,  
That as it more concerns the Turk than Rhodes,  
So may he with more facile question bear it,  
For that it stands not in such warlike brace,  
But altogether lacks the abilities  
That Rhodes is dress'd in: if we make thought of this,  
We must not think the Turk is so unskilful  
To leave that latest which concerns him first,  
Neglecting an attempt of ease and gain,  
To wake and wage a danger profitless.

**DUKE OF VENICE**  
Nay, in all confidence, he's not for Rhodes.

*Enter a Messenger*

**Messenger**  
The Ottomites, reverend and gracious,  
Steering with due course towards the isle of Rhodes,  
Have there injointed them with an after fleet.

**First Senator**  
Ay, so I thought. How many, as you guess?

**Messenger**  
Of thirty sail: and now they do restem  
Their backward course, bearing with frank appearance  
Their purposes toward Cyprus. Signior Montano,  
With his free duty recommends you thus,  
And prays you to believe him.

**DUKE OF VENICE**  
'Tis certain, then, for Cyprus.  
Marcus Luccicos, is not he in town?

**First Senator**  
He's now in Florence.

**DUKE OF VENICE**  
Write from us to him; post-post-haste dispatch.

**First Senator**  
Here comes Brabantio and the valiant Moor.

*Enter BRABANTIO, OTHELLO, IAGO, and RODERIGO*

**DUKE OF VENICE**  
Valiant Othello, we must straight employ you  
Against the general enemy Ottoman.

*\[To BRABANTIO]*  
I did not see you; welcome, gentle signior;  
We lack'd your counsel and your help tonight.

**BRABANTIO**  
So did I yours. Good your grace, pardon me;  
Neither my place nor aught I heard of business  
Hath raised me from my bed, nor doth the general care  
Take hold on me, for my particular grief  
Is of so flood-gate and o'erbearing nature  
That it engluts and swallows other sorrows  
And it is still itself. /

**DUKE OF VENICE**  
/ Why, what's the matter?

**BRABANTIO**  
My daughter! O, my daughter!  
She is abused, stol'n from me, and corrupted  
By spells and medicines bought of mountebanks;

**DUKE OF VENICE**  
Whoe'er he be that in this foul proceeding  
Hath thus beguiled your daughter of herself  
And you of her, the bloody book of law  
You shall yourself read in the bitter letter  
After your own sense, yea, though our proper son  
Stood in your action. /

**BRABANTIO**  
/ Humbly I thank your grace.  
Here is the man, this Moor, whom now, it seems,  
Your special mandate for the state-affairs  
Hath hither brought. /

**DUKE OF VENICE & First Senator**  
/ We are very sorry for't.

**DUKE OF VENICE**  
*\[To OTHELLO]*  
What, in your own part, can you say to this?

**BRABANTIO**  
Nothing, but this is so.

**OTHELLO**  
That I have ta'en away this old man's daughter,  
It is most true; true, I have married her:  
The very head and front of my offending  
Hath this extent, no more. Rude am I in my speech,  
And little bless'd with the soft phrase of peace:  
And therefore little shall I grace my cause  
In speaking for myself. Yet, by your gracious patience,  
I will a round unvarnish'd tale deliver  
Of my whole course of love; what drugs, what charms,  
For such proceeding I am charged withal,  
I won his daughter. /

**BRABANTIO**  
/ A maiden never bold;  
Of spirit so still and quiet, that her motion  
Blush'd at herself; and she, in spite of nature,  
To fall in love with what she fear'd to look on!  
It is a judgment maim'd and most imperfect  
That will confess perfection so could err  
Against all rules of nature, and must be driven  
To find out practises of cunning hell,  
Why this should be. /

**First Senator**  
/ But, Othello, speak:  
Did you by indirect and forced courses  
Subdue and poison this young maid's affections?  
Or came it by request and such fair question  
As soul to soul affordeth? /

**OTHELLO**  
/ I do beseech you,  
Send for the lady to the Sagittary,  
And let her speak of me before her father:  
If you do find me foul in her report,  
The trust, the office I do hold of you,  
Not only take away, but let your sentence  
Even fall upon my life. /

**DUKE OF VENICE**  
/ Fetch Desdemona hither.

*Exeunt IAGO*

**OTHELLO**  
And, till she come, as truly as to heaven  
I do confess the vices of my blood,  
So justly to your grave ears I'll present  
How I did thrive in this fair lady's love,  
And she in mine. /

**DUKE OF VENICE**  
/ Say it, Othello.

**OTHELLO**  
Her father loved me; oft invited me;  
Still question'd me the story of my life,  
I ran it through, even from my boyish days,  
To the very moment that he bade me tell it;  
Wherein I spake of most disastrous chances,  
Of being taken by the insolent foe  
And sold to slavery, of my redemption thence  
And portance in my travels' history:  
Rough quarries, rocks and hills whose heads touch heaven  
And of the Cannibals that each other eat,  
The Anthropophagi and men whose heads  
Do grow beneath their shoulders. This to hear  
Would Desdemona seriously incline:  
But still the house-affairs would draw her thence:  
Whichever as she could with haste dispatch,  
She'd come again, and with a greedy ear  
Devour up my discourse: which I observing,  
Took once a pliant hour, and found good means  
To draw from her a prayer of earnest heart  
And often did beguile her of her tears,  
When I did speak of some distressful stroke  
That my youth suffer'd. My story being done,  
She gave me for my pains a world of sighs:  
She swore, in faith, twas strange, 'twas passing strange,  
She wish'd she had not heard it, yet she wish'd  
That heaven had made her such a man: she thank'd me,  
And bade me, if I had a friend that loved her,  
I should but teach him how to tell my story.  
And that would woo her. Upon this hint I spake:  
She loved me for the dangers I had pass'd,  
And I loved her that she did pity them.  
This only is the witchcraft I have used:

*Enter DESDEMONA and IAGO*

**BRABANTIO**  
Come hither, gentle mistress:  
Do you perceive in all this noble company  
Where most you owe obedience? /

**DESDEMONA**  
/ My noble father,  
I do perceive here a divided duty:  
To you I am bound for life and education;  
My life and education both do learn me  
How to respect you; you are the lord of duty;  
I am hitherto your daughter: but here's my husband,  
And so much duty as my mother show'd  
To you, preferring you before her father,  
So much I challenge that I may profess  
Due to the Moor my lord. /

**BRABANTIO**  
/ Come hither, Moor:  
I here do give thee that with all my heart  
Which, but thou hast already, with all my heart  
I would keep from thee.

**DUKE OF VENICE**  
Let me speak like yourself, and lay a sentence,  
Which, as a grise or step, may help these lovers  
Into your favour.  
When remedies are past, the griefs are ended  
By seeing the worst, which late on hopes depended.  
To mourn a mischief that is past and gone  
Is the next way to draw new mischief on.  
What cannot be preserved when fortune takes  
Patience her injury a mockery makes.

**BRABANTIO**  
So let the Turk of Cyprus us beguile;  
We lose it not, so long as we can smile.  
But words are words; I never yet did hear  
That the bruised heart was pierced through the ear.  
I humbly beseech you, proceed to the affairs of state.

**DUKE OF VENICE**  
The Turk with a most mighty preparation makes for  
Cyprus. Othello, the fortitude of the place is best  
known to you; you must therefore be content to  
slubber the gloss of your new fortunes with this  
more stubborn and boisterous expedition.

**OTHELLO**  
I do agnise  
A natural and prompt alacrity  
I find in hardness, and do undertake  
These present wars against the Ottomites.  
Most humbly therefore bending to your state,  
I crave fit disposition for my wife.

**DUKE OF VENICE**  
/ If you please,  
Be't at her father's. /

**BRABANTIO**  
/ I'll not have it so. /

**OTHELLO**  
/ Nor I.

**DESDEMONA**  
Nor I; I would not there reside,  
To put my father in impatient thoughts  
By being in his eye. Most gracious duke,  
To my unfolding lend your prosperous ear;  
And let me find a charter in your voice,  
To assist my simpleness. /

**DUKE OF VENICE**  
/ What would you, Desdemona?

**DESDEMONA**  
That I did love the Moor to live with him,  
My downright violence and storm of fortunes  
May trumpet to the world: my heart's subdued  
Even to the very quality of my lord:  
I saw Othello's visage in his mind,  
And to his honour and his valiant parts  
Did I my soul and fortunes consecrate.  
So that, dear lords, if I be left behind,  
The rites for which I love him are bereft me,  
And I a heavy interim shall support  
By his dear absence. Let me go with him.

**OTHELLO**  
And heaven defend your good souls, that you think  
I will your serious and great business scant  
For she is with me: no, when light-wing'd toys  
Of feather'd Cupid seal with wanton dullness  
My speculative and officed instruments,  
That my disports corrupt and taint my business,  
Let housewives make a skillet of my helm,  
And all indign and base adversities  
Make head against my estimation!

**DUKE OF VENICE**  
Be it as you shall privately determine,  
Either for her stay or going: the affair cries haste,  
And speed must answer it.

**First Senator**  
You must away tonight. /

**OTHELLO**  
/ With all my heart.

**DUKE OF VENICE**  
At nine i' the morning here we'll meet again.  
Othello, leave some officer behind,  
And he shall our commission bring to you;  
Good night to everyone. /

*\[To BRABANTIO]*  
/ And, noble signior,  
If virtue no delighted beauty lack,  
Your son-in-law is far more fair than black.

**First Senator**  
Adieu, brave Moor, use Desdemona well.

**BRABANTIO**  
Look to her, Moor, if thou hast eyes to see:  
She has deceived her father, and may thee.

*Exeunt DUKE OF VENICE, BRABANTIO, and Senators*

**OTHELLO**  
My life upon her faith! Honest Iago,  
My Desdemona must I leave to thee:  
I prithee, let thy wife attend on her:  
And bring them after in the best advantage.  
Come, Desdemona: I have but an hour  
Of love, of worldly matters and direction,  
To spend with thee: we must obey the time.

*Exeunt OTHELLO and DESDEMONA*

**RODERIGO**  
Iago,-- /

**IAGO**  
/ What say'st thou, noble heart?

**RODERIGO**  
I will incontinently drown myself.

**IAGO**  
O villainous! I have looked upon the world for four  
times seven years; I never found man  
that knew how to love himself. Ere I would say, I  
would drown myself for the love of a guinea-hen, I  
would change my humanity with a baboon.

**RODERIGO**  
What should I do?

**IAGO**  
I have professed me thy friend and I confess me knit to thy deserving  
with cables of perdurable toughness; I could never  
better stead thee than now. Put money in thy  
purse; It cannot be that Desdemona should long continue her  
love to the Moor,-- put money in thy purse,--nor he  
his to her. These Moors are changeable in  
their wills: fill thy purse with money. She must  
change for youth: when she is sated with his body,  
she will find the error of her choice: she must  
have change, she must. Make all the money  
thou canst: thou shalt enjoy her; therefore make money. Seek  
thou rather to be hanged in compassing thy joy than  
to be drowned and go without her.

**RODERIGO**  
Wilt thou be fast to my hopes, if I depend on  
the issue?

**IAGO**  
Thou art sure of me:--go, make money:--  
Let us be conjunctive in our revenge  
against him: if thou canst cuckold him, thou dost  
thyself a pleasure, me a sport.

**RODERIGO**  
Where shall we meet i' the morning?

**IAGO**  
At my lodging.

**RODERIGO**  
I'll be with thee betimes.

**IAGO**  
Go to; farewell.  
No more of drowning, do you hear?

**RODERIGO**  
I am changed: I'll go sell all my land.

*Exit*

**IAGO**  
Thus do I ever make my fool my purse:  
I hate the Moor:  
And it is thought abroad, that 'twixt my sheets  
He has done my office: I know not if't be true;  
But I, for mere suspicion in that kind,  
Will do as if for surety. He holds me well;  
The better shall my purpose work on him.  
Cassio's a proper man: let me see now:  
After some time, to abuse Othello's ear  
That he is too familiar with his wife.  
The Moor is of a free and open nature,  
That thinks men honest that but seem to be so,  
And will as tenderly be led by the nose  
As asses are.  
I have't. It is engender'd. Hell and night  
Must bring this monstrous birth to the world's light.

*Exit*

## ACT II

### SCENE I. A Sea-port in Cyprus. An open place near the quay.

*Enter MONTANO and a Gentleman*

**MONTANO**  
What from the cape can you discern at sea?

**First Gentleman**  
Nothing at all.

**MONTANO**  
Methinks the wind hath spoke aloud at land;  
A fuller blast ne'er shook our battlements:  
If it hath ruffian'd so upon the sea,  
What ribs of oak, when mountains melt on them,  
Can hold the mortise? What shall we hear of this?

**First Gentleman**  
A segregation of the Turkish fleet:  
The wind-shaked surge, with high and monstrous mane,  
seems to cast water on the burning bear,  
And quench the guards of the ever-fixed pole:  
I never did like molestation view  
On the enchafed flood.

*Enter a Second Gentleman*

**Second Gentleman**  
News, lads! our wars are done.  
The desperate tempest hath so bang'd the Turks,  
That their designment halts.

**MONTANO**  
How! is this true? /

**Second Gentleman**  
/ The ship is here put in,  
A Veronesa; Michael Cassio,  
Lieutenant to the warlike Moor Othello,  
Is come on shore: the Moor himself at sea,  
And is in full commission here for Cyprus.  
But this same Cassio, though he speak of comfort  
Touching the Turkish loss, yet he looks sadly,  
And prays the Moor be safe; for they were parted  
With foul and violent tempest. /

**MONTANO**  
/ Pray heavens he be;  
For I have served him, and the man commands  
Like a full soldier. Let's to the seaside, ho!  
As well to see the vessel that's come in  
As to throw out our eyes for brave Othello,  
Even till we make the main and the aerial blue  
An indistinct regard.

*Enter CASSIO*

**CASSIO**  
Thanks, you the valiant of this warlike isle,  
That so approve the Moor! /

**MONTANO**  
/ Is he well shipp'd?

**CASSIO**  
His bark is stoutly timber'd, his pilot  
Of very expert and approved allowance;  
Therefore my hopes, not surfeited to death,  
Stand in bold cure.

*Exit Second Gentleman*

**MONTANO**  
But, good lieutenant, is your general wived?

**CASSIO**  
Most fortunately: he hath achieved a maid  
That paragons description and wild fame;  
One that excels the quirks of blazoning pens,  
And in the essential vesture of creation  
Does tire the ingener. /

*Re-enter second Gentleman*

/ How now! who has put in?

**Second Gentleman**  
'Tis one Iago, ancient to the general.

**CASSIO**  
Has had most favourable and happy speed:  
Tempests themselves, high seas, and howling winds,  
As having sense of beauty, do omit  
Their mortal natures, letting go safely by  
The divine Desdemona. /

**MONTANO**  
/ What is she?

**CASSIO**  
She that I spake of, our great captain's captain,  
Left in the conduct of the bold Iago.

*Enter DESDEMONA, EMILIA, IAGO, and RODERIGO*

The riches of the ship is come on shore!  
Hail to thee, lady! /

**DESDEMONA**  
/ I thank you, valiant Cassio.  
What tidings can you tell me of my lord?

**CASSIO**  
He is not yet arrived: nor know I aught  
But that he's well and will be shortly here.

**DESDEMONA**  
O, but I fear--How lost you company?

**CASSIO**  
The great contention of the sea and skies  
Parted our fellowship--But, hark! a sail.

*Within 'A sail, a sail!' Guns heard*

See for the news. /

*Exit Gentleman*

*\[To EMILIA]*  
/ Welcome, mistress.  
Let it not gall your patience, good Iago,  
That I extend my manners; 'tis my breeding  
That gives me this bold show of courtesy.  
*\[Kissing her]*

**IAGO**  
Sir, would she give you so much of her lips  
As of her tongue she oft bestows on me,  
You'll have enough.

**DESDEMONA**  
Alas, she has no speech. /

**IAGO**  
/ In faith, too much;  
I find it still, when I have list to sleep:  
She puts her tongue a little in her heart,  
And chides with thinking.

**EMILIA**  
You have little cause to say so.

**IAGO**  
Nay, it is true, or else I am a Turk:  
You rise to play and go to bed to work.

**EMILIA**  
You shall not write my praise. /

**IAGO**  
/ No, let me not.

**DESDEMONA**  
What wouldst thou write of me, if thou shouldst praise me?

**IAGO**  
O gentle lady, do not put me to't;  
For I am nothing, if not critical.

**DESDEMONA**  
Come, how wouldst thou praise me?

**IAGO**  
I am about it; but indeed my invention  
Comes from my pate as birdlime does from frize;  
It plucks out brains and all: but my Muse labours,  
And thus she is deliver'd.  
If she be fair and wise, fairness and wit,  
The one's for use, the other useth it.

**DESDEMONA**  
Well praised! How if she be black and witty?

**IAGO**  
If she be black, and thereto have a wit,  
She'll find a white that shall her blackness fit.

**DESDEMONA**  
Worse and worse. /

**EMILIA**  
/ How if fair and foolish?

**IAGO**  
She never yet was foolish that was fair;  
For even her folly help'd her to an heir.

**DESDEMONA**  
What miserable praise hast thou for  
her that's foul and foolish?

**IAGO**  
There's none so foul and foolish thereunto,  
But does foul pranks which fair and wise ones do.

**DESDEMONA**  
But what praise couldst thou bestow on a deserving  
woman indeed, one that, in the authority of her  
merit, did justly put on the vouch of very malice itself?

**IAGO**  
She that was ever fair and never proud,  
Had tongue at will and yet was never loud,  
She that in wisdom never was so frail  
To change the cod's head for the salmon's tail;  
She that could think and ne'er disclose her mind,  
See suitors following and not look behind,  
She was a wight, if ever such wight were,--

**DESDEMONA**  
To do what?

**IAGO**  
To suckle fools and chronicle small beer.

**DESDEMONA**  
O most lame and impotent conclusion! How say  
you, Cassio? is he not a most profane and liberal  
counsellor?

**CASSIO**  
He speaks home, madam: You may relish him more in  
the soldier than in the scholar.

**IAGO**  
*\[Aside]*  
He takes her by the palm: ay, well said,  
whisper: with as little a web as this will I  
ensnare as great a fly as Cassio. Ay, smile upon  
her, do; I will gyve thee in thine own courtship.  
You say true; 'tis so, indeed: if such tricks as  
these strip you out of your lieutenantry, it had  
been better you had not kissed your three fingers so  
oft, An excellent courtesy! 'tis so, indeed. Yet again your fingers  
to your lips? would they were clyster-pipes for your sake!

*Trumpet within*

The Moor! I know his trumpet. /

**CASSIO**  
/ 'Tis truly so.

*Enter OTHELLO*

**OTHELLO**  
O my fair warrior! /

**DESDEMONA**  
/ My dear Othello!

**OTHELLO**  
It gives me wonder great as my content  
To see you here before me. O my soul's joy!  
If it were now to die,  
'Twere now to be most happy; for, I fear,  
My soul hath her content so absolute  
That not another comfort like to this  
Succeeds in unknown fate. /

**DESDEMONA**  
/ The heavens forbid  
But that our loves and comforts should increase,  
Even as our days do grow! /

**OTHELLO**  
/ Amen to that, sweet powers!  
Come, let us to the castle.  
News, friends; our wars are done, the Turks are drown'd.  
I prithee, good Iago,  
Bring thou the master to the citadel;  
He is a good one, and his worthiness  
Does challenge much respect. Come, Desdemona,

*Exeunt OTHELLO and DESDEMONA*

**IAGO**  
Do thou meet me presently at the harbour. Come  
hither. The lieutenant tonight watches on the court of  
guard:--first, I must tell thee this--Desdemona is  
directly in love with him.

**RODERIGO**  
With him! why, 'tis not possible.

**IAGO**  
Mark me with what violence she first loved the Moor,  
but for bragging and telling her fantastical lies:  
and will she love him still for prating? let not  
thy discreet heart think it. Her eye must be fed;  
When the blood is made dull with the act of  
sport, there should be, again to inflame it and to  
give satiety a fresh appetite, loveliness in favour,  
sympathy in years, manners and beauties; all which  
the Moor is defective in: now, for want of these  
required conveniences, her delicate tenderness will  
find itself abused, begin to heave the gorge,  
disrelish and abhor the Moor; very nature will  
instruct her in it and compel her to some second  
choice; Besides, the  
knave is handsome, young, and hath all those  
requisites in him that folly and green minds look  
after: a pestilent complete knave; and the woman  
hath found him already.

**RODERIGO**  
I cannot believe that in her; she's full of  
most blessed condition.

**IAGO**  
Blessed fig's-end! the wine she drinks is made of  
grapes: if she had been blessed, she would never  
have loved the Moor. Blessed pudding! Didst thou  
not see her paddle with the palm of his hand?

**RODERIGO**  
Yes, that I did; but that was but courtesy.

**IAGO**  
They met  
so near with their lips that their breaths embraced  
together. Watch you tonight;  
for the command, I'll lay't upon you. Cassio knows  
you not. I'll not be far from you: do you find  
some occasion to anger Cassio, either by speaking  
too loud, or tainting his discipline;

**RODERIGO**  
Well.

**IAGO**  
Sir, he is rash and very sudden in choler, and haply  
may strike at you: provoke him, that he may.

**RODERIGO**  
I will do this, if I can bring it to any  
opportunity.

**IAGO**  
I warrant thee. Meet me by and by at the citadel:  
I must fetch his necessaries ashore. Farewell.

**RODERIGO**  
Adieu.

*Exit*

**IAGO**  
That Cassio loves her, I do well believe it;  
That she loves him, 'tis apt and of great credit:  
The Moor is of a constant, loving nature,  
And I dare think he'll prove to Desdemona  
A most dear husband. Now, I do love her too;  
Not out of absolute lust,  
But partly led to diet my revenge,  
For that I do suspect the lusty Moor  
Hath leap'd into my seat; the thought whereof  
Doth, like a poisonous mineral, gnaw my inwards;  
And nothing can or shall content my soul  
Till I am even'd with him, wife for wife,  
Or failing so, yet that I put the Moor  
At least into a jealousy so strong  
That judgment cannot cure. Which thing to do,  
If this poor trash of Venice stand the putting on,  
I'll have our Michael Cassio on the hip,  
Abuse him to the Moor in the rank garb--  
Make the Moor thank me, love me and reward me.  
For making him egregiously an ass  
And practising upon his peace and quiet  
Even to madness. 'Tis here, but yet confused:  
Knavery's plain face is never seen tin used.

*Exit*

### SCENE III. A hall in the castle.

*Enter OTHELLO, DESDEMONA, and CASSIO*

**OTHELLO**  
Good Michael, look you to the guard tonight:  
Let's teach ourselves that honourable stop,  
Not to outsport discretion.

**CASSIO**  
Iago hath direction what to do;  
But, notwithstanding, with my personal eye  
Will I look to't. /

**OTHELLO**  
/ Iago is most honest.  
Michael, good night: tomorrow with your earliest  
Let me have speech with you. /

*\[To DESDEMONA]*  
/ Come, my dear love,  
The purchase made, the fruits are to ensue;  
That profit's yet to come 'tween me and you.  
Good night.

*Exeunt OTHELLO and DESDEMONA*

*Enter IAGO*

**CASSIO**  
Welcome, Iago; we must to the watch.

**IAGO**  
Not this hour, lieutenant; 'tis not yet ten o' the  
clock. Our general cast us thus early for the love  
of his Desdemona; who let us not therefore blame:  
he hath not yet made wanton the night with her; and  
she is sport for Jove.

**CASSIO**  
She's a most exquisite lady.

**IAGO**  
And, I'll warrant her, fun of game.

**CASSIO**  
Indeed, she's a most fresh and delicate creature.

**IAGO**  
Well, happiness to their sheets! Come, lieutenant, I  
have a stoup of wine;

**CASSIO**  
Not tonight, good Iago: I have very poor and  
unhappy brains for drinking

**IAGO**  
What, man! 'tis a night of revels: the gallants  
desire it.

**CASSIO**  
Where are they?

**IAGO**  
Here at the door; I pray you, call them in.

**CASSIO**  
I'll do't; but it dislikes me.

*Exit*

**IAGO**  
If I can fasten but one cup upon him,  
He'll be as full of quarrel and offence  
As my young mistress' dog. /

*Re-enter CASSIO; with him MONTANO and a Gentleman; a servant following
with wine*

/ Some wine, ho!

**CASSIO**  
To the health of our general!

**MONTANO**  
I am for it, lieutenant; and I'll do you justice.

**IAGO**  
*\[Singing]*  
O sweet England!  
King Stephen was a worthy peer,  
His breeches cost him but a crown;  
He held them sixpence all too dear,  
With that he call'd the tailor lown.  
He was a wight of high renown,  
And thou art but of low degree:  
'Tis pride that pulls the country down;  
Then take thine auld cloak about thee.  
Some wine, ho!

**CASSIO**  
Why, tis an exquisite song. /

**IAGO**  
/ Will you hear't again?

**CASSIO**  
No; for I hold him to be unworthy of his place that  
does those things. Well, God's above all; and there  
be souls must be saved, and there be souls must not be saved.

**IAGO**  
It's true, good lieutenant.

**CASSIO**  
For mine own part, I hope to be saved.

**IAGO**  
And so do I too, lieutenant.

**CASSIO**  
Ay, but, by your leave, not before me; the  
lieutenant is to be saved before the ancient. Let's  
have no more of this; let's to our affairs.--Forgive  
us our sins!--Gentlemen, let's look to our business.  
Do not think, gentlemen. I am drunk: this is my  
ancient; this is my right hand, and this is my left:  
I am not drunk now; I can stand well enough, and  
speak well enough.

**ALL**  
Excellent well.

**CASSIO**  
Why, very well then; you must not think then that I am drunk.

*Exit*

**MONTANO**  
To the platform, masters; come, let's set the watch.

**IAGO**  
You see this fellow that is gone before;  
He is a soldier fit to stand by Caesar  
And give direction: and do but see his vice;  
I fear the trust Othello puts him in.  
On some odd time of his infirmity,  
Will shake this island. /

**MONTANO**  
/ But is he often thus?

**IAGO**  
'Tis evermore the prologue to his sleep:  
He'll watch the horologe a double set,  
If drink rock not his cradle. /

**MONTANO**  
/ It were well  
The general were put in mind of it.  
Perhaps he sees it not; or his good nature  
Prizes the virtue that appears in Cassio,  
And looks not on his evils. /

*Enter RODERIGO*

**IAGO**  
*\[Aside to him]*  
/ How now, Roderigo!  
I pray you, after the lieutenant; go.

*Exit RODERIGO*

**MONTANO**  
And 'tis great pity that the noble Moor  
Should hazard such a place as his own second  
With one of an ingraft infirmity:  
It were an honest action to say  
So to the Moor. /

**IAGO**  
/ Not I, for this fair island:  
I do love Cassio well; and would do much  
To cure him of this evil--But, hark! what noise?

*Cry within: 'Help! help!'*

*Re-enter CASSIO, driving in RODERIGO*

**CASSIO**  
You rogue! you rascal! /

**MONTANO**  
/ What's the matter, lieutenant?

**CASSIO**  
Dost thou prate, rogue? /  
*\[Striking RODERIGO]*

**MONTANO**  
/ Nay, good lieutenant;  
*\[Staying him]*

I pray you, sir, hold your hand. /

**CASSIO**  
/ Let me go, sir,  
Or I'll knock you o'er the mazzard. /

**MONTANO**  
/ Come, come,  
you're drunk. /

**CASSIO**  
/ Drunk!

*They fight*

**IAGO**  
*\[Aside to RODERIGO]*  
Away, I say; go out, and cry a mutiny.

*Exit RODERIGO*

Help, ho!--Lieutenant,--sir,--Montano,--sir;

*Bell rings*

Who's that which rings the bell?--Diablo, ho!  
The town will rise: God's will, lieutenant, hold!  
You will be shamed forever.

*Re-enter OTHELLO*

**MONTANO**  
'Zounds, I bleed still; I am hurt to the death.

**OTHELLO**  
Why, how now, ho! from whence ariseth this?  
Honest Iago, that look'st dead with grieving,  
Speak, who began this? on thy love, I charge thee.

**IAGO**  
I do not know: friends all but now, even now,  
In quarter, and in terms like bride and groom  
Devesting them for bed; and then, but now--  
As if some planet had unwitted men--  
Swords out, and tilting one at other's breast,  
In opposition bloody. I cannot speak  
Any beginning to this peevish odds;  
And would in action glorious I had lost  
Those legs that brought me to a part of it!

**OTHELLO**  
How comes it, Michael, you are thus forgot?

**CASSIO**  
I pray you, pardon me; I cannot speak.

**OTHELLO**  
Worthy Montano, you were wont be civil;  
The gravity and stillness of your youth  
The world hath noted, and your name is great  
In mouths of wisest censure: what's the matter,  
That you unlace your reputation thus  
And spend your rich opinion for the name  
Of a night-brawler? give me answer to it.

**MONTANO**  
Worthy Othello, I am hurt to danger:  
Your officer, Iago, can inform you,--  
Of all that I do know. /

**OTHELLO**  
/ Give me to know  
How this foul rout began, who set it on;  
And he that is approved in this offence,  
Though he had twinn'd with me, both at a birth,  
Shall lose me. Iago, who began't?

**MONTANO**  
If partially affined, or leagued in office,  
Thou dost deliver more or less than truth,  
Thou art no soldier. /

**IAGO**  
/ Touch me not so near:  
I had rather have this tongue cut from my mouth  
Than it should do offence to Michael Cassio;  
Yet, I persuade myself, to speak the truth.  
Montano and myself being in speech,  
There comes a fellow crying out for help:  
And Cassio following him with determined sword,  
To execute upon him. Sir, this gentleman  
Steps in to Cassio, and entreats his pause:  
Myself the crying fellow did pursue,  
he, swift of foot,  
Outran my purpose; and I return'd the rather  
For that I heard the clink and fall of swords,  
And Cassio high in oath; which till tonight  
I ne'er might say before. When I came back--  
For this was brief--I found them close together,  
At blow and thrust; even as again they were  
When you yourself did part them.

**OTHELLO**  
Thy honesty and love doth mince this matter,  
Making it light to Cassio. Cassio, I love thee  
But nevermore be officer of mine. /

*Re-enter DESDEMONA*

**DESDEMONA**  
/ What's the matter?

**OTHELLO**  
All's well now, sweeting; come away to bed.  
Iago, look with care about the town,  
And silence those whom this vile brawl distracted.  
Come, Desdemona: 'tis the soldiers' life  
To have their balmy slumbers waked with strife.

*Exeunt all but IAGO and CASSIO*

**IAGO**  
What, are you hurt, lieutenant?

**CASSIO**  
Ay, past all surgery. /

**IAGO**  
/ Marry, heaven forbid!

**CASSIO**  
Reputation, reputation, reputation! O, I have lost  
my reputation! I have lost the immortal part of  
myself, and what remains is bestial. My reputation,  
Iago, my reputation!

**IAGO**  
As I am an honest man, I thought you had received  
some bodily wound; there is more sense in that than  
in reputation. Reputation is an idle and most false  
imposition: oft got without merit, and lost without  
deserving: What, man!  
there are ways to recover the general again: you  
are but now cast in his mood, a punishment more in  
policy than in malice. Sue to him again, and he's yours.

**CASSIO**  
I will rather sue to be despised than to deceive so  
good a commander with so slight, so drunken, and so  
indiscreet an officer.

**IAGO**  
What was he that you followed with your sword? What  
had he done to you?

**CASSIO**  
I know not.  
I remember a mass of things, but nothing distinctly;  
a quarrel, but nothing wherefore. O God, that men  
should put an enemy in their mouths to steal away  
their brains! that we should, with joy, pleasance  
revel and applause, transform ourselves into beasts!

**IAGO**  
Come, you are too severe a moraler:  
I could heartily wish this had not befallen;  
but, since it is as it is, mend it for your own good.

**CASSIO**  
I will ask him for my place again; he shall tell me  
I am a drunkard. To be now a sensible man,  
by and by a fool, and presently a beast!

**IAGO**  
I'll tell you what you shall do. Our general's wife  
is now the general: may say so in this respect, for  
that he hath devoted and given up himself to the  
contemplation, mark, and denotement of her parts and  
graces: confess yourself freely to her; importune  
her help to put you in your place again:  
this broken joint between you and her husband  
entreat her to splinter; and, my fortunes against  
any lay worth naming, this crack of your love shall  
grow stronger than it was before.

**CASSIO**  
You advise me well.

**IAGO**  
I protest, in the sincerity of love and honest kindness.

**CASSIO**  
I think it freely; and betimes in the morning I will  
beseech the virtuous Desdemona to undertake for me:

**IAGO**  
You are in the right. Good night, lieutenant; I  
must to the watch.

**CASSIO**  
Good night, honest Iago.

*Exit*

**IAGO**  
And what's he then that says I play the villain?  
When this advice is free I give and honest,  
To win the Moor again? For 'tis most easy  
The inclining Desdemona to subdue  
In any honest suit: she's framed as fruitful  
As the free elements. And then for her  
To win the Moor--were't to renounce his baptism,  
His soul is so enfetter'd to her love,  
That she may make, unmake, do what she list,  
Even as her appetite shall play the god  
With his weak function. How am I then a villain  
To counsel Cassio to this parallel course,  
Directly to his good? Divinity of hell!  
When devils will the blackest sins put on,  
They do suggest at first with heavenly shows,  
As I do now: for whiles this honest fool  
Plies Desdemona to repair his fortunes  
And she for him pleads strongly to the Moor,  
I'll pour this pestilence into his ear,  
That she repeals him for her body's lust;  
And by how much she strives to do him good,  
She shall undo her credit with the Moor.  
So will I turn her virtue into pitch,  
And out of her own goodness make the net  
That shall enmesh them all. /

*Re-enter RODERIGO*

/ How now, Roderigo!

**RODERIGO**  
I do follow here in the chase, not like a hound that  
hunts, but one that fills up the cry. My money is  
almost spent; I have been tonight exceedingly well  
cudgelled; and I think the issue will be, I shall  
have so much experience for my pains, and so, with  
no money at all and a little more wit, return again to Venice.

**IAGO**  
How poor are they that have not patience!  
Does't not go well? Cassio hath beaten thee.  
And thou, by that small hurt, hast cashier'd Cassio:  
Content thyself awhile. By the mass, 'tis morning;  
Retire thee; go where thou art billeted:  
Away, I say; thou shalt know more hereafter:  
Nay, get thee gone. /

*Exit RODERIGO*

/ Two things are to be done:  
My wife must move for Cassio to her mistress;  
I'll set her on;  
Myself the while to draw the Moor apart,  
And bring him jump when he may Cassio find  
Soliciting his wife: ay, that's the way  
Dull not device by coldness and delay.

*Exit*

## ACT III

### SCENE I. Before the castle.

*Enter CASSIO and Clown*

**CASSIO**  
Dost thou hear, my honest friend?

**Clown**  
No, I hear not your honest friend; I hear you.

**CASSIO**  
Prithee, keep up thy quillets. There's a poor piece  
of gold for thee: if the gentlewoman that attends  
the general's wife be stirring, tell her there's  
one Cassio entreats her a little favour of speech:  
wilt thou do this?

**Clown**  
She is stirring, sir: if she will stir hither, I  
shall seem to notify unto her.

**CASSIO**  
Do, good my friend. /

*Exit Clown*

*Enter IAGO*

/ In happy time, Iago.

**IAGO**  
You have not been a-bed, then?

**CASSIO**  
Why, no; the day had broke  
Before we parted. I have made bold, Iago,  
To send in to your wife: my suit to her  
Is, that she will to virtuous Desdemona  
Procure me some access.

**IAGO**  
I'll send her to you presently;  
And I'll devise a mean to draw the Moor  
Out of the way, that your converse and business  
May be more free.

**CASSIO**  
I humbly thank you for't. /

*Exit IAGO*

/ I never knew  
A Florentine more kind and honest.

*Enter EMILIA*

**EMILIA**  
Good morrow, good Lieutenant: I am sorry  
For your displeasure; but all will sure be well.  
The general and his wife are talking of it;  
And she speaks for you stoutly: the Moor replies,  
That he you hurt is of great fame in Cyprus,  
And great affinity, and that in wholesome wisdom  
He might not but refuse you; but he protests he loves you  
And needs no other suitor but his likings  
To bring you in again. /

**CASSIO**  
/ Yet, I beseech you,  
Give me advantage of some brief discourse  
With Desdemona alone. /

**EMILIA**  
/ Pray you, come in;  
I will bestow you where you shall have time  
To speak your bosom freely. /

**CASSIO**  
/ I am much bound to you.

*Exeunt*

### SCENE III. The garden of the castle.

*Enter DESDEMONA, CASSIO, and EMILIA*

**DESDEMONA**  
Do not doubt, Cassio,  
But I will have my lord and you again  
As friendly as you were. You do love my lord:  
You have known him long; and be you well assured  
He shall in strangeness stand no further off  
Than in a polite distance. /

**CASSIO**  
/ Ay, but, lady,  
That policy may either last so long,  
That, I being absent and my place supplied,  
My general will forget my love and service.

**DESDEMONA**  
Do not doubt that; before Emilia here  
I give thee warrant of thy place: assure thee,  
If I do vow a friendship, I'll perform it  
To the last article: my lord shall never rest;  
I'll intermingle everything he does  
With Cassio's suit: therefore be merry, Cassio;  
For thy solicitor shall rather die  
Than give thy cause away. /

**EMILIA**  
/ Madam, here comes my lord.

**CASSIO**  
Madam, I'll take my leave. /

**DESDEMONA**  
/ Why, stay, and hear me speak.

**CASSIO**  
Madam, not now: I am very ill at ease,  
Unfit for mine own purposes.

**DESDEMONA**  
Well, do your discretion.

*Exit CASSIO*

*Enter OTHELLO and IAGO*

**IAGO**  
Ha! I like not that.

**OTHELLO**  
Was not that Cassio parted from my wife?

**IAGO**  
Cassio, my lord! No, sure, I cannot think it,  
That he would steal away so guilty-like,  
Seeing you coming.

**OTHELLO**  
I do believe 'twas he. /

**DESDEMONA**  
/ How now, my lord!  
I have been talking with a suitor here,  
A man that languishes in your displeasure.

**OTHELLO**  
Who is't you mean?

**DESDEMONA**  
Why, your lieutenant, Cassio. Good my lord,  
If I have any grace or power to move you,  
His present reconciliation take;  
For if he be not one that truly loves you,  
I have no judgment in an honest face:  
I prithee, call him back. /

**OTHELLO**  
/ Went he hence now?

**DESDEMONA**  
Ay, sooth; so humbled  
That he hath left part of his grief with me,  
To suffer with him. Good love, call him back.

**OTHELLO**  
Not now, sweet Desdemona; some other time.

**DESDEMONA**  
But shall't be shortly? /

**OTHELLO**  
/ The sooner, sweet, for you.

**DESDEMONA**  
Shall't be tonight at supper? /

**OTHELLO**  
/ No, not tonight.

**DESDEMONA**  
Why, then, tomorrow night; or Tuesday morn;  
On Tuesday noon, or night; on Wednesday morn:  
I prithee, name the time, but let it not  
Exceed three days: in faith, he's penitent;  
And yet his trespass, in our common reason--  
Save that, they say, the wars must make examples  
Out of their best--is not almost a fault  
To incur a private cheque. When shall he come?  
Tell me, Othello: I wonder in my soul,  
What you would ask me, that I should deny,  
Or stand so mammering on. What! Michael Cassio,  
That came a-wooing with you, and so many a time,  
When I have spoke of you dispraisingly,  
Hath ta'en your part; to have so much to do  
To bring him in! Trust me, I could do much,--

**OTHELLO**  
Prithee, no more. /

**DESDEMONA**  
/ Why, this is not a boon;  
'Tis as I should entreat you wear your gloves,  
Or feed on nourishing dishes, or keep you warm,  
Or sue to you to do a peculiar profit  
To your own person: nay, when I have a suit  
Wherein I mean to touch your love indeed,  
It shall be full of poise and difficult weight  
And fearful to be granted. /

**OTHELLO**  
/ I will deny thee nothing:  
Whereon, I do beseech thee, grant me this,  
To leave me but a little to myself.

**DESDEMONA**  
Shall I deny you? no: farewell, my lord.  
Whate'er you be, I am obedient.

*Exeunt DESDEMONA and EMILIA*

**IAGO**  
Did Michael Cassio, when you woo'd my lady,  
Know of your love?

**OTHELLO**  
He did, from first to last: why dost thou ask?

**IAGO**  
But for a satisfaction of my thought;  
No further harm. /

**OTHELLO**  
/ Why of thy thought, Iago?

**IAGO**  
I did not think he had been acquainted with her.

**OTHELLO**  
O, yes; and went between us very oft. /

**IAGO**  
/ Indeed!

**OTHELLO**  
Indeed! ay, indeed: discern'st thou aught in that?  
Is he not honest?

**IAGO**  
Honest, my lord! /

**OTHELLO**  
/ Honest! ay, honest.  
What dost thou think? /

**IAGO**  
/ Think, m'lord! /

**OTHELLO**  
/ Think, m'lord!  
By heaven, he echoes me,  
As if there were some monster in his thought  
Too hideous to be shown. Thou dost mean something:  
I heard thee say even now, thou likedst not that,  
When Cassio left my wife: what didst not like?

**IAGO**  
My lord, you know I love you.

**OTHELLO**  
I think thou dost; /

**IAGO**  
/ For Michael Cassio,  
I dare be sworn I think that he is honest.

**OTHELLO**  
I think so too. /

**IAGO**  
/ Men should be what they seem;  
Or those that be not, would they might seem none!

**OTHELLO**  
Certain, men should be what they seem.

**IAGO**  
Why, then, I think Cassio's an honest man.

**OTHELLO**  
Nay, yet there's more in this:  
I prithee, speak to me as to thy thinkings,  
As thou dost ruminate, and give thy worst of thoughts  
The worst of words. /

**IAGO**  
/ Good my lord, pardon me:  
Utter my thoughts? Why, say they are vile and false;  
As where's that palace whereinto foul things  
Sometimes intrude not?

**OTHELLO**  
Thou dost conspire against thy friend, Iago,  
If thou but think'st him wrong'd and makest his ear  
A stranger to thy thoughts. /

**IAGO**  
/ I do beseech you--  
Though I perchance am vicious in my guess,  
As, I confess, it is my nature's plague  
To spy into abuses, and oft my jealousy  
Shapes faults that are not--that your wisdom yet,  
Would take no notice, nor build yourself a trouble  
Out of his scattering and unsure observance.

**OTHELLO**  
By heaven, I'll know thy thoughts.

**IAGO**  
You cannot, if my heart were in your hand;  
O, beware, my lord, of jealousy;  
It is the green-eyed monster which doth mock  
The meat it feeds on; that cuckold lives in bliss  
Who, certain of his fate, loves not his wronger;  
But, O, what damned minutes tells he o'er  
Who dotes, yet doubts, suspects, yet strongly loves!  
Poor and content is rich and rich enough,  
But riches fineless is as poor as winter  
To him that ever fears he shall be poor.  
Good heaven, the souls of all my tribe defend  
From jealousy! /

**OTHELLO**  
/ Why, why is this?  
Think'st thou I'd make a lie of jealousy,  
To follow still the changes of the moon  
With fresh suspicions? No. 'Tis not to make me jealous  
To say my wife is fair, feeds well, loves company,  
Is free of speech, sings, plays and dances well;  
Where virtue is, these are more virtuous:  
Nor from mine own weak merits will I draw  
The smallest fear or doubt of her revolt;  
For she had eyes, and chose me. No, Iago;  
I'll see before I doubt; when I doubt, prove;  
And on the proof, there is no more but this,--  
Away at once with love or jealousy!

**IAGO**  
I am glad of it; for now I shall have reason  
To show the love and duty that I bear you  
With franker spirit: therefore, as I am bound,  
Receive it from me. I speak not yet of proof.  
Look to your wife; observe her well with Cassio;  
I know our country disposition well;  
In Venice they do let heaven see the pranks  
They dare not show their husbands; their best conscience  
Is not to leave't undone, but keep't unknown.

**OTHELLO**  
Dost thou say so?

**IAGO**  
She did deceive her father, marrying you;  
And when she seem'd to shake and fear your looks,  
She loved them most. /

**OTHELLO**  
/ And so she did.

**IAGO**  
Why, go to then;  
She that, so young, could give out such a seeming,  
To seal her father's eyes up close as oak-  
He thought 'twas witchcraft--but I am much to blame;  
I humbly do beseech you of your pardon  
For too much loving you.

**OTHELLO**  
I am bound to thee forever.

**IAGO**  
I hope you will consider what is spoke  
Comes from my love. But I do see you're moved:  
I am to pray you not to strain my speech  
To grosser issues nor to larger reach  
Than to suspicion.

**OTHELLO**  
I will not. /

**IAGO**  
/ Should you do so, my lord,  
My speech should fall into such vile success  
As my thoughts aim not at. Cassio's my worthy friend--  
My lord, I see you're moved. /

**OTHELLO**  
/ No, not much moved:  
I do not think but Desdemona's honest.

**IAGO**  
Long live she so! and long live you to think so!

**OTHELLO**  
And yet, how nature erring from itself,--

**IAGO**  
Ay, there's the point: as--to be bold with you--  
Not to affect many proposed matches  
Of her own clime, complexion, and degree,  
Whereto we see in all things nature tends--  
But pardon me; I do not in position  
Distinctly speak of her; though I may fear  
Her will, recoiling to her better judgment,  
May fall to match you with her country forms  
And happily repent. /

**OTHELLO**  
/ Farewell, farewell:  
If more thou dost perceive, let me know more;  
Set on thy wife to observe: leave me, Iago:

**IAGO**  
*\[Going]*  
My lord, I take my leave.

**OTHELLO**  
Why did I marry? This honest creature doubtless  
Sees and knows more, much more, than he unfolds.  
This fellow's of exceeding honesty,  
And knows all qualities, with a learned spirit,  
Of human dealings. If I do prove her haggard,  
I'd whistle her off and let her down the wind,  
To pray at fortune. Haply, for I am black  
And have not those soft parts of conversation  
That chamberers have, or for I am declined  
Into the vale of years,--yet that's not much--  
She's gone. I am abused; and my relief  
Must be to loathe her. O curse of marriage,  
That we can call these delicate creatures ours,  
And not their appetites! I had rather be a toad,  
And live upon the vapour of a dungeon,  
Than keep a corner in the thing I love  
For others' uses. Yet, 'tis the plague of great ones;  
Prerogatived are they less than the base;  
'Tis destiny unshunnable, like death:  
Even then this forked plague is fated to us  
When we do quicken. Desdemona comes:

*Re-enter DESDEMONA and EMILIA*

If she be false, O, then heaven mocks itself!  
I'll not believe't. /

**DESDEMONA**  
/ How now, my dear Othello!  
Your dinner, and the generous islanders  
By you invited, do attend your presence.

**OTHELLO**  
I am to blame. /

**DESDEMONA**  
/ Why do you speak so faintly?  
Are you not well?

**OTHELLO**  
I have a pain upon my forehead here.

**DESDEMONA**  
'Faith, that's with watching; 'twill away again:  
Let me but bind it hard, within this hour  
It will be well. /

**OTHELLO**  
/ Your napkin is too little:  
*\[He puts the handkerchief from him; and it drops]*

Let it alone. Come, I'll go in with you.

**DESDEMONA**  
I am very sorry that you are not well.

*Exeunt OTHELLO and DESDEMONA*

**EMILIA**  
I am glad I have found this napkin:  
This was her first remembrance from the Moor:  
My wayward husband hath a hundred times  
Woo'd me to steal it; but she so loves the token,  
For he conjured her she should ever keep it,  
That she reserves it evermore about her  
To kiss and talk to. I'll have the work ta'en out,  
And give't Iago: what he will do with it  
Heaven knows, not I;  
I nothing but to please his fantasy.

*Re-enter Iago*

**IAGO**  
How now! what do you here alone?

**EMILIA**  
Do not you chide; I have a thing for you.

**IAGO**  
A thing for me? it is a common thing-- /

**EMILIA**  
/ Ha!

**IAGO**  
To have a foolish wife.

**EMILIA**  
O, is that all? What will you give me now  
For the same handkerchief? /

**IAGO**  
/ What handkerchief?

**EMILIA**  
What handkerchief?  
Why, that the Moor first gave to Desdemona;  
That which so often you did bid me steal.

**IAGO**  
Hast stol'n it from her?

**EMILIA**  
No, 'faith; she let it drop by negligence.  
And, to the advantage, I, being here, took't up.  
Look, here it is. /

**IAGO**  
/ A good wench; give it me.

**EMILIA**  
What will you do with 't?

**IAGO**  
*\[Snatching it]*  
Be not acknown on 't; I have use for it.  
Go, leave me.

*Exit EMILIA*

I will in Cassio's lodging lose this napkin,  
And let him find it.  
The Moor already changes with my poison:  
Dangerous conceits are, in their natures, poisons.  
Which at the first are scarce found to distaste,  
But with a little act upon the blood.

*Re-enter OTHELLO*

**OTHELLO**  
Avaunt! be gone! thou hast set me on the rack:  
I swear 'tis better to be much abused  
Than but to know't a little. /

**IAGO**  
/ How now, my lord!

**OTHELLO**  
What sense had I of her stol'n hours of lust?  
I saw't not, thought it not, it harm'd not me:  
I found not Cassio's kisses on her lips:  
He that is robb'd, not wanting what is stol'n,  
Let him not know't, and he's not robb'd at all.

**IAGO**  
I am sorry to hear this.

**OTHELLO**  
Farewell the tranquil mind! farewell content!  
Farewell the neighing steed, and the shrill trump,  
The royal banner, and all quality,  
Pride, pomp and circumstance of glorious war!  
And, O you mortal engines, whose rude throats  
The immortal Jove's dead clamours counterfeit,  
Farewell! Othello's occupation's gone!

**IAGO**  
Is't possible, my lord?

**OTHELLO**  
Villain, be sure thou prove my love a whore,  
Be sure of it; give me the ocular proof:  
Or by the worth of man's eternal soul,  
Thou hadst been better have been born a dog  
Than answer my waked wrath! /

**IAGO**  
/ My noble lord,--

**OTHELLO**  
If thou dost slander her and torture me,  
Never pray more; abandon all remorse;  
For nothing canst thou to damnation add  
Greater than that. /

**IAGO**  
/ O grace! O heaven forgive me!  
God be wi' you; take mine office. O wretched fool.  
O monstrous world! Take note, take note, O world,  
To be direct and honest is not safe.  
I thank you for this profit; and from hence  
I'll love no friend, sith love breeds such offence.

**OTHELLO**  
Nay, stay: thou shouldst be honest.

**IAGO**  
I should be wise, for honesty's a fool  
And loses that it works for. /

**OTHELLO**  
/ By the world,  
I think my wife be honest and think she is not;  
I think that thou art just and think thou art not.  
I'll have some proof. Her name, that was as fresh  
As Dian's visage, is now begrimed and black  
As mine own face. Would I were satisfied!

**IAGO**  
And may: but, how? how satisfied, my lord?  
Would you, the supervisor, grossly gape on--  
Behold her topp'd? /

**OTHELLO**  
/ Death and damnation! O!

**IAGO**  
It were a tedious difficulty, I think,  
To bring them to that prospect: damn them then,  
If ever mortal eyes do see them bolster  
More than their own! What then? how then?

**OTHELLO**  
Give me a living reason she's disloyal.

**IAGO**  
I do not like the office:  
But, sith I am enter'd in this cause so far,  
Prick'd to't by foolish honesty and love,  
I will go on. I lay with Cassio lately;  
In sleep I heard him say 'Sweet Desdemona,  
Let us be wary, let us hide our loves;'  
And then, sir, would he gripe and wring my hand,  
Cry 'O sweet creature!' and then kiss me hard,  
Cried 'Cursed fate that gave thee to the Moor!'  
Nay, this was but his dream.

**OTHELLO**  
I'll tear her all to pieces.

**IAGO**  
Nay, but be wise: yet we see nothing done;  
She may be honest yet. Tell me but this,  
Have you not sometimes seen a handkerchief  
Spotted with strawberries in your wife's hand?

**OTHELLO**  
I gave her such a one; 'twas my first gift.

**IAGO**  
I know not that; but such a handkerchief--  
I am sure it was your wife's--did I today  
See Cassio wipe his beard with. /

**OTHELLO**  
/ If it be that--

**IAGO**  
If it be that, or any that was hers,  
It speaks against her with the other proofs.

**OTHELLO**  
O, that the slave had forty thousand lives!  
One is too poor, too weak for my revenge.  
Arise, black vengeance, from thy hollow cell!  
Yield up, O love, thy crown and hearted throne  
To tyrannous hate! Swell, bosom, with thy fraught,  
For 'tis of aspics' tongues! /

**IAGO**  
/ Yet be content.

**OTHELLO**  
O, blood, blood, blood!

**IAGO**  
Patience, I say; your mind perhaps may change.

**OTHELLO**  
Iago, my bloody thoughts, with violent pace,  
Shall ne'er look back, ne'er ebb to humble love,  
Till that a capable and wide revenge  
Swallow them up.

**IAGO**  
Witness that here Iago doth give up  
The execution of his wit, hands, heart,  
To wrong'd Othello's service! Let him command,  
And to obey shall be in me remorse,  
What bloody business ever. /

*They rise*

**OTHELLO**  
/ I greet thy love,  
Within these three days let me hear thee say  
That Cassio's not alive.

**IAGO**  
My friend is dead; 'tis done at your request:  
But let her live. /

**OTHELLO**  
/ Damn her, lewd minx! O, damn her!  
Come, go with me apart; I will withdraw,  
To furnish me with some swift means of death  
For the fair devil. Now art thou my lieutenant.

**IAGO**  
I am your own forever.

*Exeunt*

### SCENE IV. Before the castle.

*Enter DESDEMONA, EMILIA, and Clown*

**DESDEMONA**  
Do you know, sirrah, where Lieutenant Cassio lies?

**Clown**  
I dare not say he lies anywhere.

**DESDEMONA**  
Why, man?

**Clown**  
He's a soldier, and for one to say a soldier lies,  
is stabbing.

**DESDEMONA**  
Go to: where lodges he?

**Clown**  
To tell you where he lodges, is to tell you where I lie.

**DESDEMONA**  
Can anything be made of this?

**Clown**  
I know not where he lodges, and for me to devise a  
lodging and say he lies here or he lies there, were  
to lie in mine own throat.

**DESDEMONA**  
Seek him, bid him come hither: tell him I have  
moved my lord on his behalf, and hope all will be well.

**Clown**  
To do this is within the compass of man's wit: and  
therefore I will attempt the doing it.

*Exit*

**DESDEMONA**  
Where should I lose that handkerchief, Emilia?

**EMILIA**  
I know not, madam.

**DESDEMONA**  
Believe me, I had rather have lost my purse  
Full of crusadoes: and, but my noble Moor  
Is true of mind and made of no such baseness  
As jealous creatures are, it were enough  
To put him to ill thinking. /

**EMILIA**  
/ Is he not jealous?

**DESDEMONA**  
Who, he? I think the sun where he was born  
Drew all such humours from him.

**EMILIA**  
Look, where he comes.

**DESDEMONA**  
I will not leave him now till Cassio  
Be call'd to him. /

*Enter OTHELLO*

/ How is't with you, my lord

**OTHELLO**  
Well, my good lady. /

*\[Aside]*  
/ O, hardness to dissemble!--

*\[To DESDEMONA]*  
How do you, Desdemona? /

**DESDEMONA**  
/ Well, my good lord.

**OTHELLO**  
Give me your hand: this hand is moist, my lady.

**DESDEMONA**  
It yet hath felt no age nor known no sorrow.

**OTHELLO**  
This argues fruitfulness and liberal heart:  
Hot, hot, and moist: 'Tis a good hand,  
A frank one. /

**DESDEMONA**  
/ You may, indeed, say so;  
For 'twas that hand that gave away my heart.

**OTHELLO**  
A liberal hand: the hearts of old gave hands;  
But our new heraldry is hands, not hearts.

**DESDEMONA**  
I cannot speak of this. Come now, your promise.

**OTHELLO**  
What promise, chuck?

**DESDEMONA**  
I have sent to bid Cassio come speak with you.

**OTHELLO**  
I have a salt and sorry rheum offends me;  
Lend me thy handkerchief. /

**DESDEMONA**  
/ Here, my lord.

**OTHELLO**  
That which I gave you. /

**DESDEMONA**  
/ I have it not about me.

**OTHELLO**  
Not? /

**DESDEMONA**  
/ No, indeed, my lord. /

**OTHELLO**  
/ Fetch't, let me see't.

**DESDEMONA**  
Why, so I can, sir, but I will not now.  
This is a trick to put me from my suit:  
Pray you, let Cassio be received again.

**OTHELLO**  
Fetch me the handkerchief: my mind misgives.

**DESDEMONA**  
Come, come;  
You'll never meet a more sufficient man.

**OTHELLO**  
The handkerchief! /

**DESDEMONA**  
/ I pray, talk me of Cassio.

**OTHELLO**  
The handkerchief!

**DESDEMONA**  
A man that all his time  
Hath founded his good fortunes on your love,  
Shared dangers with you,-- /

**OTHELLO**  
/ The handkerchief!

**DESDEMONA**  
/ In sooth, you are to blame.

**OTHELLO**  
Away!

*Exit*

**EMILIA**  
Is not this man jealous?

**DESDEMONA**  
I ne'er saw this before.

**EMILIA**  
'Tis not a year or two shows us a man:  
They are all but stomachs, and we all but food;  
To eat us hungerly, and when they are full,  
They belch us. Look you, Cassio and my husband!

*Enter CASSIO and IAGO*

**DESDEMONA**  
How now, good Cassio! what's the news with you?

**CASSIO**  
Madam, my former suit: I do beseech you  
That by your virtuous means I may again  
Exist, and be a member of his love  
Whom I with all the office of my heart  
Entirely honour: I would not be delay'd.

**DESDEMONA**  
My advocation is not now in tune;  
My lord is not my lord; nor should I know him,  
Were he in favour as in humour alter'd.  
So help me every spirit sanctified,  
As I have spoken for you all my best  
And stood within the blank of his displeasure  
For my free speech! you must awhile be patient.

**IAGO**  
Is my lord angry? /

**EMILIA**  
/ He went hence but now,  
And certainly in strange unquietness.

**IAGO**  
Something of moment then: I will go meet him.

**DESDEMONA**  
I prithee, do so. /

*Exit IAGO*

/ Something, sure, of state,  
Either from Venice, or some unhatch'd practise  
Made demonstrable here in Cyprus to him,  
Men's natures wrangle with inferior things,  
Though great ones are their object.  
Nay, we must think men are not gods,  
Nor of them look for such observances  
As fit the bridal. Beshrew me much, Emilia,  
I was, unhandsome warrior as I am,  
Arraigning his unkindness with my soul;  
But now I find I had suborn'd the witness,  
And he's indicted falsely.

**EMILIA**  
Pray heaven it be state-matters, as you think,  
And no conception nor no jealous toy  
Concerning you.

**DESDEMONA**  
Alas the day! I never gave him cause.

**EMILIA**  
But jealous souls will not be answer'd so;  
They are not ever jealous for the cause,  
But jealous for they are jealous: 'tis a monster  
Begot upon itself, born on itself.

**DESDEMONA**  
Heaven keep that monster from Othello's mind!  
I will go seek him. Cassio, walk hereabout:  
If I do find him fit, I'll move your suit  
And seek to effect it to my uttermost.

**CASSIO**  
I humbly thank your ladyship.

*Exeunt DESDEMONA and EMILIA*

*Enter BIANCA*

**BIANCA**  
Save you, friend Cassio! /

**CASSIO**  
/ What make you from home?  
How is it with you, my most fair Bianca?  
I' faith, sweet love, I was coming to your house.

**BIANCA**  
And I was going to your lodging, Cassio.  
What, keep a week away? seven days and nights?  
Eight score eight hours? and lovers' absent hours,  
More tedious than the dial eight score times?  
O weary reckoning! /

**CASSIO**  
/ Pardon me, Bianca:  
I have this while with leaden thoughts been press'd:  
But I shall, in a more continuate time,  
Strike off this score of absence. Sweet Bianca,

*\[Giving her DESDEMONA's handkerchief]*  
Take me this work out.

**BIANCA**  
O Cassio, whence came this?  
This is some token from a newer friend:  
To the felt absence now I feel a cause:  
Is't come to this? Well, well. /

**CASSIO**  
/ Go to, woman!  
Throw your vile guesses in the devil's teeth,  
From whence you have them. You are jealous now  
That this is from some mistress, some remembrance:  
No, in good troth, Bianca. /

**BIANCA**  
/ Why, whose is it?

**CASSIO**  
I know not, sweet: I found it in my chamber.  
I like the work well: ere it be demanded--  
As like enough it will--I'd have it copied:  
Take it, and do't; and leave me for this time.

**BIANCA**  
Leave you! wherefore?

**CASSIO**  
I do attend here on the general;

**BIANCA**  
I pray you, bring me on the way a little,  
And say if I shall see you soon at night.

**CASSIO**  
'Tis but a little way that I can bring you;  
For I attend here: but I'll see you soon.

**BIANCA**  
'Tis very good; I must be circumstanced.

*Exeunt*

## ACT IV

### SCENE I. Cyprus. Before the castle.

*Enter OTHELLO and IAGO*

**IAGO**  
Will you think so? /

**OTHELLO**  
/ Think so, Iago! /

**IAGO**  
/ What,  
To kiss in private? /

**OTHELLO**  
/ An unauthorized kiss.

**IAGO**  
Or to be naked with her friend in bed  
An hour or more, not meaning any harm?

**OTHELLO**  
Naked in bed, Iago, and not mean harm!  
It is hypocrisy against the devil:

**IAGO**  
So they do nothing, 'tis a venial slip:  
But if I give my wife a handkerchief,--

**OTHELLO**  
What then?

**IAGO**  
Why, then, 'tis hers, my lord; and, being hers,  
She may, I think, bestow't on any man.

**OTHELLO**  
She is protectress of her honour too:  
May she give that?

**IAGO**  
Her honour is an essence that's not seen;  
They have it very oft that have it not:  
But, for the handkerchief,--

**OTHELLO**  
By heaven, I would most gladly have forgot it.  
Thou said'st, it comes o'er my memory,  
As doth the raven o'er the infected house,  
Boding to all--he had my handkerchief.

**IAGO**  
Ay, what of that? /

**OTHELLO**  
/ That's not so good now. /

**IAGO**  
/ What,  
If I had said I had seen him do you wrong?

**OTHELLO**  
What hath he said?

**IAGO**  
'Faith, that he did--I know not what he did.

**OTHELLO**  
What? what? /

**IAGO**  
/ Lie-- /

**OTHELLO**  
/ With her?

**IAGO**  
With her, on her; what you will.

**OTHELLO**  
Lie with her! lie on her! We say lie on her, when  
they belie her. Lie with her! that's fulsome.  
--Handkerchief--confessions--handkerchief!--To  
confess, and be hanged for his labour;--first, to be  
hanged, and then to confess.--I tremble at it.  
Nature would not invest herself in such shadowing  
passion without some instruction. It is not words  
that shake me thus. Pish! Noses, ears, and lips.  
--Is't possible?--Confess--handkerchief!--O devil!--  
*\[Falls in a trance]*

**IAGO**  
Work on,  
My medicine, work! Thus credulous fools are caught;  
And many worthy and chaste dames even thus,  
My lord, I say! Othello! /

*Enter CASSIO*

/ How now, Cassio!

**CASSIO**  
What's the matter?

**IAGO**  
My lord is fall'n into an epilepsy:  
Look he stirs:  
Do you withdraw yourself a little while,  
He will recover straight: when he is gone,  
I would on great occasion speak with you.

*Exit CASSIO*

How is it, general? have you not hurt your head?

**OTHELLO**  
Dost thou mock me? /

**IAGO**  
/ I mock you! no, by heaven.  
Would you would bear your fortune like a man!  
Stand you awhile apart;  
Confine yourself but in a patient list.  
Whilst you were here o'erwhelmed with your grief--  
Cassio came hither: I shifted him away,  
Bade him anon return and here speak with me;  
The which he promised. Do but encave yourself,  
For I will make him tell the tale anew,  
Where, how, how oft, how long ago, and when  
He hath, and is again to cope your wife:  
I say, but mark his gesture.

**OTHELLO**  
I will be found most cunning in my patience;

**IAGO**  
Will you withdraw?

*OTHELLO retires*

Now will I question Cassio of Bianca,  
A housewife that by selling her desires  
Buys herself bread and clothes: it is a creature  
That dotes on Cassio;  
He, when he hears of her, cannot refrain  
From the excess of laughter. Here he comes:

*Re-enter CASSIO*

How do you now, lieutenant?

**CASSIO**  
The worser that you give me the addition  
Whose want even kills me.

**IAGO**  
Ply Desdemona well, and you are sure on't.

*\[Speaking lower]*  
Now, if this suit lay in Bianco's power,  
How quickly should you speed! /

**CASSIO**  
/ Alas, poor caitiff!

**OTHELLO**  
Look, how he laughs already!

**IAGO**  
I never knew woman love man so.

**CASSIO**  
Alas, poor rogue! I think, i' faith, she loves me.

**OTHELLO**  
Now he denies it faintly, and laughs it out.

**OTHELLO**  
Iago beckons me; now he begins the story.

**CASSIO**  
She was here even now; she haunts me in every place.  
I was the other day talking on the sea-bank with  
certain Venetians; and thither comes the bauble,  
and, by this hand, she falls me thus about my neck--

**OTHELLO**  
Crying 'O dear Cassio!' as it were: his gesture  
imports it.

**CASSIO**  
So hangs, and lolls, and weeps upon me; so hales,  
and pulls me: ha, ha, ha!

**OTHELLO**  
Now he tells how she plucked him to my chamber. O,  
I see that nose of yours, but not that dog I shall  
throw it to.

**CASSIO**  
Well, I must leave her company.

**IAGO**  
Before me! look, where she comes.

**CASSIO**  
'Tis such another fitchew! marry a perfumed one.

*Enter BIANCA*

What do you mean by this haunting of me?

**BIANCA**  
Let the devil and his dam haunt you! What did you  
mean by that same handkerchief you gave me even now?  
I was a fine fool to take it. I must take out the  
work?--A likely piece of work, that you should find  
it in your chamber, and not know who left it there!  
This is some minx's token, and I must take out the  
work? There; give it your hobby-horse: wheresoever  
you had it, I'll take out no work on't.

**CASSIO**  
How now, my sweet Bianca! how now! how now!

**OTHELLO**  
By heaven, that should be my handkerchief!

**BIANCA**  
An you'll come to supper tonight, you may; an you  
will not, come when you are next prepared for.

*Exit*

**IAGO**  
After her, after her.

**CASSIO**  
'Faith, I must; she'll rail in the street else.

*Exit CASSIO*

**OTHELLO**  
*\[Advancing]*  
How shall I murder him, Iago?

**IAGO**  
Did you perceive how he laughed at his vice?  
And did you see the handkerchief? /

**OTHELLO**  
/ Was that mine?

**IAGO**  
Yours by this hand: and to see how he prizes the  
foolish woman your wife! she gave it him, and he  
hath given it his whore.

**OTHELLO**  
Ay, let her rot, and perish, and be damned tonight;  
for she shall not live: no, my heart is turned to  
stone; I strike it, and it hurts my hand. O, the  
world hath not a sweeter creature: she might lie by  
an emperor's side and command him tasks.

**IAGO**  
She's the worse for all this.

**OTHELLO**  
O, a thousand thousand times: and then, of so  
gentle a condition! but yet the pity of it, Iago!  
O Iago, the pity of it, Iago!  
I will chop her into messes: cuckold me!  
Get me some poison, Iago; this night: I'll not  
expostulate with her, lest her body and beauty  
unprovide my mind again: this night, Iago.

**IAGO**  
Do it not with poison, strangle her in her bed, even  
the bed she hath contaminated.  
And for Cassio, let me be his undertaker: you  
shall hear more by midnight.

**OTHELLO**  
Excellent good.

*A trumpet within*

What trumpet is that same?

**IAGO**  
Something from Venice, sure. 'Tis Lodovico  
Come from the duke: and, see, your wife is with him.

*Enter LODOVICO, and DESDEMONA*

**LODOVICO**  
Save you, worthy general! /

**OTHELLO**  
/ With all my heart, sir.

*Othello gives him a letter; he opens the letter, and reads*

**DESDEMONA**  
And what's the news, good cousin Lodovico?

**IAGO**  
I am very glad to see you, signior  
Welcome to Cyprus.

**LODOVICO**  
I thank you. How does Lieutenant Cassio?

**IAGO**  
Lives, sir.

**DESDEMONA**  
Cousin, there's fall'n between him and my lord  
An unkind breach: but you shall make all well.

**OTHELLO**  
Are you sure of that? /

**DESDEMONA**  
/ My lord?

**OTHELLO**  
*\[Reads]*  
'This fail you not to do, as you will--'

**LODOVICO**  
He did not call; he's busy in the paper.  
Is there division 'twixt my lord and Cassio?

**DESDEMONA**  
A most unhappy one: I would do much  
To atone them, for the love I bear to Cassio.

**OTHELLO**  
Fire and brimstone! /

**DESDEMONA**  
/ My lord? /

**OTHELLO**  
/ Are you wise? /

**DESDEMONA**  
/ My lord?

**OTHELLO**  
I am glad to see you mad. /

**DESDEMONA**  
/ Why, sweet Othello,-- /

**OTHELLO**  
*\[Striking her]*  
/ Devil!

**DESDEMONA**  
I have not deserved this.

**LODOVICO**  
My lord, this would not be believed in Venice,  
Though I should swear I saw't: 'tis very much:  
Make her amends; she weeps. /

**OTHELLO**  
/ O devil, devil!  
If that the earth could teem with woman's tears,  
Each drop she falls would prove a crocodile.  
Out of my sight! /

**DESDEMONA**  
/ I will not stay to offend you.  
*\[Going]*

**OTHELLO**  
Cassio shall have my place. And, sir, tonight,  
I do entreat that we may sup together:

*Exit*

**LODOVICO**  
Is this the noble Moor whom our full senate  
Call all in all sufficient? Is this the nature  
Whom passion could not shake?

**IAGO**  
He's that he is: I may not breathe my censure  
What he might be: if what he might he is not,  
I would to heaven he were! /

**LODOVICO**  
/ What, strike his wife!

**IAGO**  
'Faith, that was not so well; yet would I knew  
That stroke would prove the worst! /

**LODOVICO**  
/ Is it his use?  
Or did the letters work upon his blood,  
And new-create this fault? /

**IAGO**  
/ Alas, alas!  
It is not honesty in me to speak  
What I have seen and known. You shall observe him,  
And his own courses will denote him so  
That I may save my speech: do but go after,  
And mark how he continues.

**LODOVICO**  
I am sorry that I am deceived in him.

*Exeunt*

### SCENE II. A room in the castle.

*Enter OTHELLO and EMILIA*

**OTHELLO**  
You have seen nothing then?

**EMILIA**  
Nor ever heard, nor ever did suspect.

**OTHELLO**  
Yes, you have seen Cassio and she together.

**EMILIA**  
But then I saw no harm, and then I heard  
Each syllable that breath made up between them.

**OTHELLO**  
What, did they never whisper? /

**EMILIA**  
/ Never, my lord.

**OTHELLO**  
Nor send you out o' the way? /

**EMILIA**  
/ Never.

**OTHELLO**  
To fetch her fan, her gloves, her mask, nor nothing?

**EMILIA**  
Never, my lord. /

**OTHELLO**  
/ That's strange.

**EMILIA**  
I durst, my lord, to wager she is honest,  
Lay down my soul at stake: if you think other,  
Remove your thought; it doth abuse your bosom.  
If any wretch have put this in your head,  
Let heaven requite it with the serpent's curse!  
For, if she be not honest, chaste, and true,  
There's no man happy; the purest of their wives  
Is foul as slander. /

**OTHELLO**  
/ Bid her come hither: go.

*Exit EMILIA*

She says enough; yet she's a simple bawd  
That cannot say as much. This is a subtle whore,  
A closet lock and key of villanous secrets  
And yet she'll kneel and pray; I have seen her do't.

*Enter DESDEMONA with EMILIA*

**DESDEMONA**  
My lord, what is your will? /

**OTHELLO**  
/ Pray, chuck, come hither.

**DESDEMONA**  
What is your pleasure? /

**OTHELLO**  
/ Let me see your eyes;  
Look in my face. /

**DESDEMONA**  
/ What horrible fancy's this?

**OTHELLO**  
*\[To EMILIA]*  
Some of your function, mistress;  
Leave procreants alone and shut the door;  
Cough, or cry 'hem,' if anybody come.

*Exit EMILIA*

**DESDEMONA**  
Upon my knees, what doth your speech import?  
I understand a fury in your words.  
But not the words. /

**OTHELLO**  
/ Why, what art thou?

**DESDEMONA**  
Your wife, my lord; your true  
And loyal wife. /

**OTHELLO**  
/ Come, swear it, damn thyself  
Lest, being like one of heaven, the devils themselves  
Should fear to seize thee: therefore be double damn'd:  
Swear thou art honest.

**DESDEMONA**  
Heaven doth truly know it.

**OTHELLO**  
Heaven truly knows that thou art false as hell.

**DESDEMONA**  
To whom, my lord? with whom? how am I false?  
Am I the motive of these tears, my lord?  
If haply you my father do suspect  
An instrument of this your calling back,  
Lay not your blame on me: If you have lost him,  
Why, I have lost him too. /

**OTHELLO**  
/ O thou weed,  
Who art so lovely fair and smell'st so sweet  
That the sense aches at thee, would thou hadst ne'er been born!

**DESDEMONA**  
Alas, what ignorant sin have I committed?

**OTHELLO**  
Was this fair paper, this most goodly book,  
Made to write 'whore' upon? What committed!  
I should make very forges of my cheeks,  
That would to cinders burn up modesty,  
Did I but speak thy deeds. What committed!  
Impudent strumpet! /

**DESDEMONA**  
/ By heaven, you do me wrong.

**OTHELLO**  
Are you not a strumpet? /

**DESDEMONA**  
/ No, as I am a Christian:  
If to preserve this vessel for my lord  
From any other foul unlawful touch  
Be not to be a strumpet, I am none.

**OTHELLO**  
What, not a whore? /

**DESDEMONA**  
/ No, as I shall be saved.

**OTHELLO**  
I cry you mercy, then:  
I took you for that cunning whore of Venice  
That married with Othello. /

*Re-enter EMILIA*

/ You, you, ay, you!  
We have done our course; there's money for your pains:  
I pray you, turn the key and keep our counsel.

*Exit*

**EMILIA**  
Good madam, what's the matter with my lord?

**DESDEMONA**  
Who is thy lord? /

**EMILIA**  
/ He that is yours, sweet lady.

**DESDEMONA**  
I have none: do not talk to me, Emilia;  
I cannot weep; nor answer have I none,  
But what should go by water. Prithee, tonight  
Lay on my bed my wedding sheets: remember;  
And call thy husband hither.

*Exit*

'Tis meet I should be used so, very meet.  
How have I been behaved, that he might stick  
The small'st opinion on my least misuse?

*Re-enter EMILIA with IAGO*

**IAGO**  
What is your pleasure, madam?  
How is't with you?

**DESDEMONA**  
I cannot tell. Those that do teach young babes  
Do it with gentle means and easy tasks:  
He might have chid me so; for, in good faith,  
I am a child to chiding.

**IAGO**  
What's the matter, lady?

**EMILIA**  
Alas, Iago, my lord hath so bewhored her.

**DESDEMONA**  
Am I that name, Iago? /

**IAGO**  
/ What name, fair lady?

**EMILIA**  
He call'd her whore: a beggar in his drink  
Could not have laid such terms upon his callat.

**IAGO**  
Why did he so?

**DESDEMONA**  
I do not know; I am sure I am none such.

**EMILIA**  
Hath she forsook so many noble matches,  
Her father and her country and her friends,  
To be call'd whore? would it not make one weep?

**DESDEMONA**  
It is my wretched fortune.

**EMILIA**  
I will be hang'd, if some eternal villain,  
Some cogging, cozening slave, to get some office,  
Have not devised this slander; I'll be hang'd else.

**IAGO**  
Fie, there is no such man; it is impossible.

**DESDEMONA**  
If any such there be, heaven pardon him!

**EMILIA**  
Why should he call her whore? who keeps her company?  
The Moor's abused by some most villanous knave,  
Some base notorious knave, some scurvy fellow.  
O heaven, that such companions thou'dst unfold,  
And put in every honest hand a whip  
To lash the rascals naked through the world  
Even from the east to the west!

**IAGO**  
Speak within door.

**EMILIA**  
O, fie upon them! Some such squire he was  
That turn'd your wit the seamy side without,  
And made you to suspect me with the Moor.

**IAGO**  
You are a fool; go to. /

**DESDEMONA**  
/ O good Iago,  
What shall I do to win my lord again?  
I know not how I lost him. Here I kneel:  
If e'er my will did trespass 'gainst his love,  
Either in discourse of thought or actual deed,  
Or that mine eyes, mine ears, or any sense,  
Delighted them in any other form;  
Or that I do not yet, and ever did.  
And ever will--though he do shake me off  
To beggarly divorcement--love him dearly,  
Comfort forswear me! Unkindness may do much;  
And his unkindness may defeat my life,  
But never taint my love. I cannot say 'whore:'  
It does abhor me now I speak the word;  
To do the act that might the addition earn  
Not the world's mass of vanity could make me.

*Trumpets within*

**IAGO**  
Hark, how these instruments summon to supper!  
Go in, and weep not; all things shall be well.

*Exeunt DESDEMONA and EMILIA*

*Enter RODERIGO*

How now, Roderigo!

**RODERIGO**  
I do not find that thou dealest justly with me.  
Every day thou daffest me with some device, Iago;  
and rather, as it seems to me now, keepest from me  
all conveniency than suppliest me with the least  
advantage of hope. I will indeed no longer endure  
it, nor am I yet persuaded to put up in peace what  
already I have foolishly suffered.

**IAGO**  
Will you hear me, Roderigo?

**RODERIGO**  
'Faith, I have heard too much, for your words and  
performances are no kin together.  
I have wasted myself out of my means.  
The jewels you have had from me to  
deliver to Desdemona would half have corrupted a  
votarist: you have told me she hath received them  
and returned me expectations and comforts of sudden  
respect and acquaintance, but I find none.  
I tell you 'tis not very well. I will make myself  
known to Desdemona: if she will return me my  
jewels, I will give over my suit and repent my  
unlawful solicitation; if not, assure yourself I  
will seek satisfaction of you.

**IAGO**  
Why, now I see there's mettle in thee, and even from  
this instant to build on thee a better opinion than  
ever before. Give me thy hand, Roderigo: thou hast  
taken against me a most just exception; but yet, I  
protest, I have dealt most directly in thy affair.

**RODERIGO**  
It hath not appeared.

**IAGO**  
I grant indeed it hath not appeared, and your  
suspicion is not without wit and judgment. But,  
Roderigo, if thou hast that in thee indeed, I mean  
purpose, courage and valour, this night show it: if  
thou the next night following enjoy not Desdemona,  
take me from this world with treachery and devise  
engines for my life.

**RODERIGO**  
Well, what is it? is it within reason and compass?

**IAGO**  
Sir, there is especial commission come from Venice  
to depute Cassio in Othello's place.  
He goes into Mauritania and takes away with  
him the fair Desdemona, unless his abode be  
lingered here by some accident: wherein none can be  
so determinate as the removing of Cassio.

**RODERIGO**  
How do you mean, removing of him?

**IAGO**  
Why, by making him uncapable of Othello's place;  
knocking out his brains.

**RODERIGO**  
And that you would have me to do?

**IAGO**  
Ay, if you dare do yourself a profit and a right.

**RODERIGO**  
I will hear further reason for this.

**IAGO**  
And you shall be satisfied.

*Exeunt*

### SCENE III. Another room In the castle.

*Enter OTHELLO, LODOVICO, DESDEMONA, and EMILIA*

**OTHELLO**  
Will you walk, sir? O,--Desdemona,--

**DESDEMONA**  
My lord?

**OTHELLO**  
Get you to bed on the instant; I will be returned  
forthwith: dismiss your attendant there: look it be done.

**DESDEMONA**  
I will, my lord.

*Exeunt OTHELLO and LODOVICO*

He hath commanded me to go to bed,  
And bade me to dismiss you. /

**EMILIA**  
/ Dismiss me!

**DESDEMONA**  
It was his bidding: therefore, good Emilia,  
Give me my nightly wearing, and adieu:  
We must not now displease him.

**EMILIA**  
I would you had never seen him!

**DESDEMONA**  
So would not I my love doth so approve him,  
That even his stubbornness, his cheques, his frowns--  
Prithee, unpin me,--have grace and favour in them.  
My mother had a maid call'd Barbara:  
She was in love, and he she loved proved mad  
And did forsake her: she had a song of 'willow;'  
An old thing 'twas, but it express'd her fortune,  
And she died singing it: that song tonight  
Will not go from my mind;  
--Hark! who is't that knocks?

**EMILIA**  
It's the wind. /

**DESDEMONA**  
/ Tell me, Emilia,--  
That there be women do abuse their husbands  
In such gross kind? /

**EMILIA**  
/ There be some such, no question.

**DESDEMONA**  
Wouldst thou do such a deed for all the world?

**EMILIA**  
Why, would not you? /

**DESDEMONA**  
/ No, by this heavenly light!

**EMILIA**  
Nor I neither by this heavenly light;  
I might do't as well i' the dark.

**DESDEMONA**  
Wouldst thou do such a deed for all the world?

**EMILIA**  
The world's a huge thing: it is a great price.  
For a small vice.

**DESDEMONA**  
In troth, I think thou wouldst not.

**EMILIA**  
In troth, I think I should; and undo't when I had  
done. Marry, I would not do such a thing for a  
joint-ring, nor for gowns, petticoats, nor any petty  
exhibition; but for the whole world,--why, who would  
not make her husband a cuckold to make him a  
monarch?

**DESDEMONA**  
Beshrew me, if I would do such a wrong  
For the whole world.  
I do not think there is any such woman.

**EMILIA**  
Yes, a dozen; and as many to the vantage as would  
store the world they played for.  
But I do think it is their husbands' faults  
If wives do fall: say that they slack their duties,  
And pour our treasures into foreign laps,  
Or else break out in peevish jealousies,  
Throwing restraint upon us; or say they strike us,  
Or scant our former having in despite;  
Why, we have galls, and though we have some grace,  
Yet have we some revenge. Let husbands know  
Their wives have sense like them: they see and smell  
And have their palates both for sweet and sour,  
As husbands have. What is it that they do  
When they change us for others? Is it sport?  
I think it is: and doth affection breed it?  
I think it doth: is't frailty that thus errs?  
It is so too: and have not we affections,  
Desires for sport, and frailty, as men have?  
Then let them use us well: else let them know,  
The ills we do, their ills instruct us so.

**DESDEMONA**  
Good night, good night: heaven me such uses send,  
Not to pick bad from bad, but by bad mend!

## ACT V

### SCENE I. Cyprus. A street.

*Enter IAGO and RODERIGO*

**IAGO**  
Here, stand behind this bulk; straight will he come:  
Wear thy good rapier bare, and put it home:  
Quick, quick; fear nothing; I'll be at thy elbow:

**RODERIGO**  
Be near at hand; I may miscarry in't.

**IAGO**  
Here, at thy hand: be bold, and take thy stand.  
*\[Retires]*

**RODERIGO**  
I have no great devotion to the deed;  
And yet he hath given me satisfying reasons:  
'Tis but a man gone. Forth, my sword: he dies.

*Enter CASSIO*

**RODERIGO**  
I know his gait, 'tis he.--Villain, thou diest!

*Makes a pass at CASSIO*

**CASSIO**  
That thrust had been mine enemy indeed,  
But that my coat is better than thou know'st  
I will make proof of thine. /

*Draws, and wounds RODERIGO*

**RODERIGO**  
/ O, I am slain!

*IAGO from behind wounds CASSIO in the leg, and exit*

**CASSIO**  
I am maim'd forever. Help, ho! murder! murder!  
*\[Falls]*

*Enter OTHELLO*

**OTHELLO**  
The voice of Cassio: Iago keeps his word.

*Exit OTHELLO*

**CASSIO**  
O, help, ho! light! a surgeon!

*Enter LODOVICO and GRATIANO*

**CASSIO**  
What, ho! no watch? no passage? murder! murder!

**GRATIANO**  
'Tis some mischance; the cry is very direful.

**CASSIO**  
O, help! /

**LODOVICO**  
/ Hark! /

**RODERIGO**  
/ O wretched villain!

**LODOVICO**  
Two or three groan: it is a heavy night:  
These may be counterfeits.

*Re-enter IAGO, with a light*

**GRATIANO**  
Here's one comes in his shirt, with light and weapons.

**IAGO**  
Who's there? whose noise is this that ones on murder?

**CASSIO**  
Iago? O, I am spoil'd, undone by villains!  
Give me some help. /

*To LODOVICO and GRATIANO*

**RODERIGO**  
/ O, help me here!

**CASSIO**  
That's one of them. /

**IAGO**  
/ O murderous slave! O villain!  
*\[Stabs RODERIGO]*

**RODERIGO**  
O damn'd Iago! O inhuman dog!

**IAGO**  
Kill men i' the dark!--Where be these bloody thieves?--  
Signior Lodovico? /

**LODOVICO**  
/ He, sir.

**IAGO**  
I cry you mercy. Here's Cassio hurt by villains.

**GRATIANO**  
Cassio! /

**IAGO**  
/ How is't, brother!

**CASSIO**  
My leg is cut in two. /

**IAGO**  
/ Marry, heaven forbid!  
Light, gentlemen; I'll bind it with my shirt.

*Enter BIANCA*

**BIANCA**  
What is the matter, ho? who is't that cried?

**IAGO**  
Who is't that cried!

**BIANCA**  
O my dear Cassio! my sweet Cassio! O Cassio,  
Cassio, Cassio!

**IAGO**  
O notable strumpet! Cassio, may you suspect  
Who they should be that have thus many led you?

**CASSIO**  
No.

**GRATIANO**  
I am to find you thus: I have been to seek you.

**BIANCA**  
Alas, he faints! O Cassio, Cassio, Cassio!

**IAGO**  
Gentlemen all, I do suspect this trash  
To be a party in this injury.  
Lend me a light. Know we this face or no?  
Alas my friend and my dear countryman  
Roderigo! no:--yes, sure: O heaven! Roderigo.

**GRATIANO**  
What, of Venice?

**IAGO**  
Even he, sir; did you know him? /

**GRATIANO**  
/ Know him! ay.  
Some good man bear him carefully from hence;  
I'll fetch the general's surgeon. /

*\[To BIANCA]*  
/ For you, mistress,  
Save you your labour. He that lies slain here, Cassio,  
Was my dear friend: what malice was between you?

**CASSIO**  
None in the world; nor do I know the man.

*Enter EMILIA*

**EMILIA**  
'Las, what's the matter? what's the matter, husband?

**IAGO**  
Cassio hath here been set on in the dark  
By Roderigo and fellows that are scaped:  
He's almost slain, and Roderigo dead.

**EMILIA**  
Alas, good gentleman! alas, good Cassio!

**IAGO**  
This is the fruit of whoring. Prithee, Emilia,  
Go know of Cassio where he supp'd tonight.

**BIANCA**  
He supp'd at my house.

**IAGO**  
O, did he so? I charge you, go with me.

**EMILIA**  
Fie, fie upon thee, strumpet!

**BIANCA**  
I am no strumpet; but of life as honest  
As you that thus abuse me.

**IAGO**  
Kind gentlemen, let's go see poor Cassio dress'd.  
Come, mistress, you must tell's another tale.  
Emilia run you to the citadel,  
And tell my lord and lady what hath happ'd.  
Will you go on? I pray. /

*\[Aside]*  
/ This is the night  
That either makes me or fordoes me quite.

*Exeunt*

### SCENE II. A bedchamber in the castle: DESDEMONA in bed asleep; a light burning.

*Enter OTHELLO*

**OTHELLO**  
It is the cause, it is the cause, my soul,--  
Let me not name it to you, you chaste stars!--  
It is the cause. Yet I'll not shed her blood;  
Nor scar that whiter skin of hers than snow,  
Yet she must die, else she'll betray more men.  
Put out the light, and then put out the light:  
Should I repent me: but once put out thy light,  
I know not where is that Promethean heat  
That can thy light relume. When I have pluck'd the rose,  
I cannot give it vital growth again.  
It must needs wither: I'll smell it on the tree.

*\[Kissing her]*  
Ah balmy breath, that dost almost persuade  
Justice to break her sword! One more, one more.  
One more, and this the last:  
So sweet was ne'er so fatal. I must weep,  
But they are cruel tears: this sorrow's heavenly;  
It strikes where it doth love. She wakes.

**DESDEMONA**  
Who's there? Othello? /

**OTHELLO**  
/ Ay. Desdemona.

**DESDEMONA**  
Will you come to bed, my lord?

**OTHELLO**  
Have you pray'd tonight, Desdemona?

**DESDEMONA**  
Ay, my lord.

**OTHELLO**  
If you bethink yourself of any crime  
Unreconciled as yet to heaven and grace,  
Solicit for it straight.

**DESDEMONA**  
Alas, my lord, what do you mean by that?

**OTHELLO**  
Well, do it, and be brief; I will walk by:  
I would not kill thy unprepared spirit;  
No; heaven forfend! I would not kill thy soul.

**DESDEMONA**  
Talk you of killing? /

**OTHELLO**  
/ Ay, I do. /

**DESDEMONA**  
/ Then heaven  
Have mercy on me! /

**OTHELLO**  
/ Amen, with all my heart!  
Think on thy sins. /

**DESDEMONA**  
/ They are loves I bear to you.

**OTHELLO**  
Ay, and for that thou diest.

**DESDEMONA**  
That death's unnatural that kills for loving.  
Some bloody passion shakes your very frame:

**OTHELLO**  
Peace, and be still!

**DESDEMONA**  
I will so. What's the matter?

**OTHELLO**  
That handkerchief which I so loved and gave thee  
Thou gave'st to Cassio. /

**DESDEMONA**  
/ No, by my life and soul!  
Send for the man, and ask him. /

**OTHELLO**  
/ Sweet soul, take heed,  
Take heed of perjury; thou art on thy deathbed.

**DESDEMONA**  
Ay, but not yet to die. /

**OTHELLO**  
/ Yes, presently:  
Therefore confess thee freely of thy sin;  
For to deny each article with oath  
Cannot remove nor choke the strong conception  
That I do groan withal. Thou art to die.

**DESDEMONA**  
Then Lord have mercy on me! /

**OTHELLO**  
/ I say, amen.

**DESDEMONA**  
And have you mercy too! I never did  
Offend you in my life; never loved Cassio  
But with such general warranty of heaven  
As I might love: I never gave him token.

**OTHELLO**  
O perjured woman! thou dost stone my heart,  
And makest me call what I intend to do  
A murder, which I thought a sacrifice:  
I saw the handkerchief. /

**DESDEMONA**  
/ He found it then;  
I never gave it him: send for him hither;  
Let him confess a truth. /

**OTHELLO**  
/ He hath confess'd.

**DESDEMONA**  
What, my lord? /

**OTHELLO**  
/ That he hath used thee.

**DESDEMONA**  
He will not say so. /

**OTHELLO**  
/ No, his mouth is stopp'd;  
Honest Iago hath ta'en order for't.

**DESDEMONA**  
O! my fear interprets: what, is he dead?

**OTHELLO**  
Out, strumpet! weep'st thou for him to my face?

**DESDEMONA**  
O, banish me, my lord, but kill me not!

**OTHELLO**  
Down, strumpet!

**DESDEMONA**  
Kill me tomorrow: let me live tonight!

**OTHELLO**  
Nay, if you strive-- /

**DESDEMONA**  
/ But half an hour!

**OTHELLO**  
Being done, there is no pause.

**DESDEMONA**  
But while I say one prayer! /

**OTHELLO**  
/ It is too late.  
*\[He stifles her]*

**EMILIA**  
*\[Within]*  
My lord, my lord! what, ho! my lord, my lord!

**OTHELLO**  
What noise is this? Not dead? not yet quite dead?  
I would not have thee linger in thy pain: So, so.

**EMILIA**  
*\[Within]*  
O, good my lord, I would speak a word with you!

**OTHELLO**  
Yes: 'tis Emilia. By and by. She's dead.  
If she come in, she'll sure speak to my wife:  
My wife! my wife! what wife? I have no wife.

**EMILIA**  
*\[Within]*  
I do beseech you  
That I may speak with you, O, good my lord!

**OTHELLO**  
I had forgot thee: O, come in, Emilia;  
Soft; by and by. Let me the curtains draw.  
Where art thou? /  
*\[Unlocks the door]*

*Enter EMILIA*

/ What's the matter with thee now?

**EMILIA**  
O, my good lord, yonder's foul murders done!

**OTHELLO**  
What, now? /

**EMILIA**  
/ But now, my lord.

**OTHELLO**  
It is the very error of the moon;  
She comes more nearer earth than she was wont,  
And makes men mad.

**EMILIA**  
Cassio, my lord, hath kill'd a young Venetian  
Call'd Roderigo. /

**OTHELLO**  
/ Roderigo kill'd!  
And Cassio kill'd! /

**EMILIA**  
/ No, Cassio is not kill'd.

**DESDEMONA**  
O, falsely, falsely murder'd!

**EMILIA**  
Out, and alas! that was my lady's voice.  
Sweet Desdemona! O sweet mistress, speak!

**DESDEMONA**  
A guiltless death I die. /

**EMILIA**  
/ O, who hath done this deed?

**DESDEMONA**  
Nobody; I myself. Farewell  
Commend me to my kind lord: O, farewell!  
*\[Dies]*

**OTHELLO**  
She turn'd to folly, and she was a whore.

**EMILIA**  
Thou dost belie her, and thou art a devil.

**OTHELLO**  
She was false 's water. /

**EMILIA**  
/ Thou art rash 's fire, t' say  
That she was false: O, she was heavenly true!

**OTHELLO**  
Cassio did top her; ask thy husband else.

**EMILIA**  
My husband! /

**OTHELLO**  
/ Thy husband. /

**EMILIA**  
/ That she was false to wedlock?

**OTHELLO**  
Ay, with Cassio. Nay, had she been true,  
If heaven would make me such another world  
Of one entire and Perfect chrysolite,  
I'd not have sold her for it. /

**EMILIA**  
/ My husband!

**OTHELLO**  
What needs this iteration, woman? I say thy husband.

**EMILIA**  
O mistress, villany hath made mocks with love,  
My husband say that she was false! /

**OTHELLO**  
/ He, woman;  
I say thy husband: dost understand the word?

**EMILIA**  
If he say so, may his pernicious soul  
Rot half a grain a day! he lies to the heart:  
She was too fond of her most filthy bargain.  
This deed of thine is no more worthy heaven  
Than thou wast worthy her.  
Thou hast not half that power to do me harm  
As I have to be hurt. O gull! O dolt!  
As ignorant as dirt! thou hast done a deed--  
I care not for thy sword; --Help! help, ho! help!  
The Moor hath kill'd my mistress! Murder! murder!

*Enter MONTANO, GRATIANO, and IAGO*

**MONTANO**  
What is the matter? How now, general!

**EMILIA**  
O, are you come, Iago? you have done well,  
That men must lay their murders on your neck.

**GRATIANO**  
What is the matter?

**EMILIA**  
Disprove this villain, if thou be'st a man:  
He says thou told'st him that his wife was false:  
I know thou didst not, thou'rt not such a villain:  
Speak, for my heart is full.

**IAGO**  
I told him what I thought, and told no more  
Than what he found himself was apt and true.

**EMILIA**  
But did you ever tell him she was false?

**IAGO**  
I did.

**EMILIA**  
You told a lie, an odious, damned lie;  
She false with Cassio!--did you say with Cassio?

**IAGO**  
With Cassio, mistress. Go to, charm your tongue.

**EMILIA**  
I will not charm my tongue; I am bound to speak:  
My mistress here lies murder'd in her bed,--  
And your reports have set the murder on.

**IAGO**  
What, are you mad? I charge you, get you home.

**EMILIA**  
Good gentlemen, let me have leave to speak:  
'Tis proper I obey him, but not now.  
Perchance, Iago, I will ne'er go home.

**OTHELLO**  
O! O! O!

*He falls on the bed*

**EMILIA**  
Nay, lay thee down and roar;  
For thou hast kill'd the sweetest innocent  
That e'er did lift up eye. /

**OTHELLO**  
*\[Rising]*  
/ O, she was foul!  
'Tis pitiful; but yet Iago knows  
That she with Cassio hath the act of shame  
A thousand times committed; Cassio confess'd it  
And she did gratify his amorous works  
With that recognizance and pledge of love  
Which I first gave her; I saw it in his hand:

**EMILIA**  
O heaven! O heavenly powers!

**IAGO**  
Come, hold your peace.

**EMILIA**  
'Twill out, 'twill out: I peace!  
No, I will speak as liberal as the north:  
Let heaven and men and devils, let them all,  
All, all, cry shame against me, yet I'll speak.

**IAGO**  
Be wise, and get you home. /

**EMILIA**  
/ I will not. /

*IAGO offers to stab EMILIA*

**GRATIANO**  
/ Fie!  
Your sword upon a woman?

**EMILIA**  
O thou dull Moor! that handkerchief thou speak'st of  
I found by fortune and did give my husband;  
For often, with a solemn earnestness,  
He begg'd of me to steal it. /

**IAGO**  
/ Villanous whore!

**EMILIA**  
She give it Cassio! no, alas! I found it,  
And I did give't my husband. /

**IAGO**  
/ Filth, thou liest!

**EMILIA**  
By heaven, I do not, I do not, gentlemen.  
O murderous coxcomb! what should such a fool  
Do with so good a woman? /

**OTHELLO**  
/ Are there no stones in heaven  
But what serve for the thunder?--Precious villain!

*OTHELLO runs at IAGO, IAGO, from behind, stabs EMILIA, and exit*

**EMILIA**  
Ay, ay: O, lay me by my mistress' side.

**GRATIANO**  
He's gone, but his wife's kill'd.

**MONTANO**  
'Tis a notorious villain. Take you this weapon,  
Which I have here recover'd from the Moor:  
Come, guard the door without; let him not pass,  
But kill him rather. I'll after that same villain,  
For 'tis a damned slave.

*Exeunt MONTANO and GRATIANO*

**EMILIA**  
Moor, she was chaste; she loved thee, cruel Moor;  
So come my soul to bliss, as I speak true;  
So speaking as I think, I die, I die.  
*\[Dies]*

**OTHELLO**  
I have another weapon in this chamber;  
It is a sword of Spain, the ice-brook's temper:--  
O, here it is. Here is my journey's end.  
Now, how dost thou look now? O ill-starr'd wench!  
Pale as thy smock! when we shall meet at compt,  
This look of thine will hurl my soul from heaven,  
And fiends will snatch at it. Cold, cold, my girl!  
O Desdemona! Desdemona! dead!

*Enter LODOVICO, GRATIANO, MONTANO, CASSIO and Officer  with IAGO,
prisoner*

**LODOVICO**  
Where is this rash and most unfortunate man?

**OTHELLO**  
That's he that was Othello: here I am.

**LODOVICO**  
Where is that viper? bring the villain forth.

**OTHELLO**  
I look down towards his feet; but that's a fable.  
If that thou best a devil, I cannot kill thee.  
*\[Wounds IAGO]*

**LODOVICO**  
Wrench his sword from him.

**IAGO**  
I bleed, sir; but not kill'd.

**OTHELLO**  
I am not sorry neither: I'd have thee live;  
For, in my sense, 'tis happiness to die.

**LODOVICO**  
O thou Othello, thou wert once so good,  
Fall'n in the practise of a damned slave,  
What shall be said to thee? /

**OTHELLO**  
/ Why, anything:  
An honourable murderer, if you will;  
For nought I did in hate, but all in honour.

**LODOVICO**  
This wretch hath part confess'd his villany:  
Did you and he consent in Cassio's death?

**OTHELLO**  
Ay.

**CASSIO**  
Dear general, I never gave you cause.

**OTHELLO**  
I do believe it, and I ask your pardon.  
Will you, I pray, demand that demi-devil  
Why he hath thus ensnared my soul and body?

**IAGO**  
Demand me nothing: what you know, you know:  
From this time forth I never will speak word.

**LODOVICO**  
Sir, you shall understand what hath befall'n,  
Which, as I think, you know not. Here is a letter  
Found in the pocket of the slain Roderigo;  
And here another: the one of them imports  
The death of Cassio to be undertook  
By Roderigo.

**OTHELLO**  
How came you, Cassio, by that handkerchief  
That was my wife's? /

**CASSIO**  
/ I found it in my chamber:  
And he himself confess'd but even now  
That there he dropp'd it for a special purpose  
Which wrought to his desire. /

**OTHELLO**  
/ O fool! fool! fool!

**LODOVICO**  
You must forsake this room, and go with us:  
Your power and your command is taken off,  
And Cassio rules in Cyprus. For this slave,  
If there be any cunning cruelty  
That can torment him much and hold him long,  
It shall be his. You shall close prisoner rest,  
Till that the nature of your fault be known  
To the Venetian state. Come, bring him away.

**OTHELLO**  
Soft you; a word or two before you go.  
I have done the state some service, and they know't.  
No more of that. I pray you, in your letters,  
Speak of me as I am; then must you speak  
Of one that loved not wisely but too well;  
Of one not easily jealous, but being wrought  
Perplex'd in the extreme; of one whose hand,  
Threw a pearl away of one whose subdued eyes,  
Drop tears as fast as the Arabian trees  
Their medicinal gum. Set you down this;  
And say besides, that in Aleppo once,  
Where a malignant and a turban'd Turk  
Beat a Venetian and traduced the state,  
I took by the throat the circumcised dog,  
And smote him, thus.  
*\[Stabs himself]*

I kiss'd thee ere I kill'd thee: no way but this;  
Killing myself, to die upon a kiss.  
*\[Falls on the bed, and dies]*

**CASSIO**  
This did I fear, but thought he had no weapon;  
For he was great of heart. /

**LODOVICO**  
*\[To IAGO]*  
/ O Spartan dog,  
More fell than anguish, hunger, or the sea!  
Look on the tragic loading of this bed;  
This is thy work: the object poisons sight;  
Let it be hid. Gratiano, keep the house,  
And seize upon the fortunes of the Moor,  
For they succeed on you. To you, lord governor,  
Remains the censure of this hellish villain;  
The time, the place, the torture: O, enforce it!  
Myself will straight aboard: and to the state  
This heavy act with heavy heart relate.

*Exeunt*

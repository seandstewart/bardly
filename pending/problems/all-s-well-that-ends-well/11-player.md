## ACT I

### SCENE I. Rousillon. The COUNT's palace.

*Enter BERTRAM, the COUNTESS of Rousillon, HELENA, and LAFEU, all in black*

**COUNTESS**  
In delivering my son from me, I bury a second husband.

**BERTRAM**  
And I in going, madam, weep o'er my father's death  
anew: but I must attend his majesty's command, to  
whom I am now in ward, evermore in subjection.

**COUNTESS**  
What hope is there of his majesty's amendment?

**LAFEU**  
He hath abandoned his physicians, madam; under whose  
practises he hath persecuted time with hope, and  
finds no other advantage in the process but only the  
losing of hope by Time.

**COUNTESS**  
This young gentlewoman had a father,--O, that  
'had'! how sad a passage 'tis!--whose skill was  
almost as great as his honesty; had it stretched so  
far, would have made nature immortal, and death  
should have play for lack of work. Would, for the  
king's sake, he were living! I think it would be  
the death of the king's disease.

**LAFEU**  
How called you the man you speak of, madam?

**COUNTESS**  
He was famous, sir, in his profession, and it was  
his great right to be so: Gerard de Narbon.

**LAFEU**  
He was excellent indeed, madam: the king very  
lately spoke of him admiringly and mourningly: he  
was skillful enough to have lived still, if knowledge  
could be set up against mortality. Was this gentlewoman  
the daughter of Gerard de Narbon?

**COUNTESS**  
His sole child, my lord, and bequeathed to my  
overlooking. I have those hopes of her good that  
her education promises; her dispositions she  
inherits, which makes fair gifts fairer; for where  
an unclean mind carries virtuous qualities, there  
commendations go with pity; they are virtues and  
traitors too; in her they are the better for their  
simpleness; she derives her honesty and achieves her goodness.

**LAFEU**  
Your commendations, madam, get from her tears.

**COUNTESS**  
No more of this, Helena; go to, no more;  
lest it be rather thought you affect  
a sorrow than have it.

**BERTRAM**  
Madam, I desire your holy wishes.

**COUNTESS**  
Be thou blest, Bertram, and succeed thy father  
In manners, as in shape! thy blood and virtue  
Contend for empire in thee, and thy goodness  
Share with thy birthright! Love all, trust a few,  
Do wrong to none: be able for thine enemy  
Rather in power than use, and keep thy friend  
Under thy own life's key: be check'd for silence,  
But never tax'd for speech. What heaven more will,  
That thee may furnish and my prayers pluck down,  
Fall on thy head! Farewell, my lord;  
'Tis an unseason'd courtier; good my lord,  
Advise him. ...

**LAFEU**  
... He cannot want the best  
That shall attend his love. ...

**COUNTESS**  
... Heaven bless him!
Farewell, Bertram. ...

*Exit*

**BERTRAM**  
*\[To HELENA]*  
... The best wishes that can  
Be forged in your thoughts be servants to you!
Be comfortable to my mother, your mistress,
And make much of her. ...

**LAFEU**  
... Farewell, pretty lady:  
You must hold the credit of your father.

*Exeunt BERTRAM and LAFEU*

**HELENA**  
O, were that all! I think not on my father;  
And these great tears grace his remembrance more  
Than those I shed for him. What was he like?  
I have forgot him: my imagination  
Carries no favor in't but Bertram's.  
I am undone: there is no living, none,  
If Bertram be away. 'Twere all one  
That I should love a bright particular star  
And think to wed it, he is so above me:  
In his bright radiance and collateral light  
Must I be comforted, not in his sphere.  
The ambition in my love thus plagues itself:  
The hind that would be mated by the lion  
Must die for love. 'Twas pretty, though plague,  
To see him every hour; to sit and draw  
His arched brows, his hawking eye, his curls,  
In our heart's table; heart too capable  
Of every line and trick of his sweet favor:  
But now he's gone, and my idolatrous fancy  
Must sanctify his relics. Who comes here?

*Enter PAROLLES*

*\[Aside]*  
One that goes with him: I love him for his sake;  
And yet I know him a notorious liar,  
Think him a great way fool, solely a coward;  
Yet these fixed evils sit so fit in him,  
That they take place, when virtue's steely bones  
Look bleak i' the cold wind: withal, full oft we see  
Cold wisdom waiting on superfluous folly.

**PAROLLES**  
Save you, fair queen!

**HELENA**  
And you, monarch!

**PAROLLES**  
No.

**HELENA**  
And no.

**PAROLLES**  
Are you meditating on virginity?

**HELENA**  
Ay. You have some stain of soldier in you: let me  
ask you a question. Man is enemy to virginity; how  
may we barricado it against him?

**PAROLLES**  
Keep him out.

**HELENA**  
But he assails; and our virginity, though valiant,  
in the defense yet is weak: unfold to us some  
warlike resistance.

**PAROLLES**  
There is none: man, sitting down before you, will  
undermine you and blow you up.

**HELENA**  
Bless our poor virginity from underminers and  
blowers up! Is there no military policy, how  
virgins might blow up men?

**PAROLLES**  
Virginity being blown down, man will quicklier be  
blown up: marry, in blowing him down again, with  
the breach yourselves made, you lose your city. It  
is not politic in the commonwealth of nature to  
preserve virginity. Loss of virginity is rational  
increase and there was never virgin got till  
virginity was first lost. That you were made of is  
metal to make virgins. Virginity by being once lost  
may be ten times found; by being ever kept, it is  
ever lost: 'tis too cold a companion; away with 't!

**HELENA**  
I will stand for 't a little, though therefore I die a virgin.

**PAROLLES**  
There's little can be said in 't; 'tis against the  
rule of nature. To speak on the part of virginity,  
is to accuse your mothers; which is most infallible  
disobedience. Virginity breeds mites,  
much like a cheese; consumes itself to the very  
paring, and so dies with feeding his own stomach.  
Besides, virginity is peevish, proud, idle, made of  
self-love, which is the most inhibited sin in the  
canon. Keep it not; you cannot choose but loose  
by't: out with 't!

**HELENA**  
How might one do, sir, to lose it to her own liking?

**PAROLLES**  
Let me see: marry, ill, to like him that ne'er it  
likes. 'Tis a commodity will lose the gloss with  
lying; the longer kept, the less worth: off with 't  
while 'tis vendible; answer the time of request.  
Virginity is a withered pear: will you anything with it?

**HELENA**  
Not my virginity yet  
There shall your master have a thousand loves;  
His humble ambition, proud humility,  
His jarring concord, and his discord dulcet,  
His faith, his sweet disaster; with a world  
Of pretty, fond, adoptious christendoms,  
That blinking Cupid gossips. Now shall he--  
I know not what he shall. God send him well!  
The court's a learning place, and he is one--

**PAROLLES**  
What one, i' faith?

**HELENA**  
That I wish well. 'Tis pity--

**PAROLLES**  
What's pity?

**HELENA**  
That wishing well had not a body in't,  
Which might be felt; that we, the poorer born,  
Whose baser stars do shut us up in wishes,  
Might with effects of them follow our friends,  
And show what we alone must think, which never  
Return us thanks.

*Enter Page*

**Page**  
Monsieur Parolles, my lord calls for you.

*Exit*

**PAROLLES**  
Little Helen, farewell; if I can remember thee, I  
will think of thee at court.

**HELENA**  
Monsieur Parolles, you were born under a charitable star.

**PAROLLES**  
Under Mars, I.

**HELENA**  
I especially think, under Mars.

**PAROLLES**  
Why under Mars?

**HELENA**  
The wars have so kept you under that you must needs  
be born under Mars.

**PAROLLES**  
When he was predominant.

**HELENA**  
When he was retrograde, I think, rather.

**PAROLLES**  
Why think you so?

**HELENA**  
You go so much backward when you fight.

**PAROLLES**  
That's for advantage.

**HELENA**  
So is running away, when fear proposes the safety;  
but the composition that your valor and fear makes  
in you is a virtue of a good wing, and I like the wear well.

**PAROLLES**  
I am so full of businesses, I cannot answer thee  
acutely. I will return perfect courtier; in the  
which, my instruction shall serve to naturalize  
thee, so thou wilt be capable of a courtier's  
counsel and understand what advice shall thrust upon  
thee; else thou diest in thine unthankfulness, and  
thine ignorance makes thee away: farewell. When  
thou hast leisure, say thy prayers; when thou hast  
none, remember thy friends; get thee a good husband,  
and use him as he uses thee; so, farewell.

*Exit*

**HELENA**  
Our remedies oft in ourselves do lie,  
Which we ascribe to heaven: the fated sky  
Gives us free scope, only doth backward pull  
Our slow designs when we ourselves are dull.  
What power is it which mounts my love so high,  
That makes me see, and cannot feed mine eye?  
The mightiest space in fortune nature brings  
To join like likes and kiss like native things.  
Impossible be strange attempts to those  
That weigh their pains in sense and do suppose  
What hath been cannot be: who ever strove  
So show her merit, that did miss her love?  
The king's disease--my project may deceive me,  
But my intents are fix'd and will not leave me.

*Exit*

### SCENE II. Paris. The KING's palace.

*Flourish of cornets. Enter the KING of France, with letters, and Attendants*

**KING**  
The Florentines and Senoys are by the ears;  
Have fought with equal fortune and continue  
A braving war. ...

**First Lord**  
... So 'tis reported, sir.

**KING**  
Nay, 'tis most credible; we here received it  
A certainty, vouch'd from our cousin Austria,  
With caution that the Florentine will move us  
For speedy aid; wherein our dearest friend  
Prejudicates the business and would seem  
To have us make denial. ...

**First Lord**  
... His love and wisdom,  
Approved so to your majesty, may plead  
For amplest credence. ...

**KING**  
... He hath arm'd our answer,  
And Florence is denied before he comes:  
Yet, for our gentlemen that mean to see  
The Tuscan service, freely have they leave  
To stand on either part. ...

**Second Lord**  
... It well may serve  
A nursery to our gentry, who are sick  
For breathing and exploit. ...

**KING**  
... What's he comes here?

*Enter BERTRAM, LAFEU, and PAROLLES*

**First Lord**  
Young Bertram. ...

**KING**  
... Youth, thou bear'st thy father's face;  
Frank nature, rather curious than in haste,  
Hath well composed thee. Thy father's moral parts  
Mayst thou inherit too! Welcome to Paris.

**BERTRAM**  
My thanks and duty are your majesty's.

**KING**  
I would I had that corporal soundness now,  
As when thy father and myself in friendship  
First tried our soldiership! He did look far  
Into the service of the time and was  
Discipled of the bravest: he lasted long;  
But on us both did haggish age steal on  
And wore us out of act. It much repairs me  
To talk of your good father. How long is't  
Since the physician at your father's died?  
He was much famed. ...

**BERTRAM**  
... Some six months since, my lord.

**KING**  
If he were living, I would try him yet.  
Lend me an arm; the rest have worn me out  
With several applications; nature and sickness  
Debate it at their leisure. Welcome, count;  
My son's no dearer. ...

**BERTRAM**  
... Thank your majesty.

*Exeunt. Flourish*

### SCENE III. Rousillon. The COUNT's palace.

*Enter COUNTESS, Steward, and Clown*

**COUNTESS**  
I will now hear; what say you of this gentlewoman?  
What does this knave here? Get you gone, sirrah:  
the complaints I have heard of you I do not all  
believe: 'tis my slowness that I do not; for I know  
you lack not folly to commit them, and have ability  
enough to make such knaveries yours.

**Clown**  
'Tis not unknown to you, madam, I am a poor fellow.

**COUNTESS**  
Well, sir.

**Clown**  
No, madam, 'tis not so well that I am poor, though  
many of the rich are damned: but, if I may have  
your ladyship's good will to go to the world, Isbel  
the woman and I will do as we may.

**COUNTESS**  
Wilt thou needs be a beggar?

**Clown**  
I do beg your good will in this case.

**COUNTESS**  
In what case?

**Clown**  
In Isbel's case and mine own. Service is no  
heritage: and I think I shall never have the  
blessing of God till I have issue o' my body; for  
they say barnes are blessings.

**COUNTESS**  
Tell me thy reason why thou wilt marry.

**Clown**  
My poor body, madam, requires it: I am driven on  
by the flesh; and he must needs go, that the devil drives.

**COUNTESS**  
Is this all your worship's reason?

**Clown**  
Faith, madam, I have other holy reasons such as they  
are.

**COUNTESS**  
May the world know them?

**Clown**  
I have been, madam, a wicked creature, as you and  
all flesh and blood are; and, indeed, I do marry  
that I may repent.

**COUNTESS**  
Thy marriage, sooner than thy wickedness.

**Clown**  
I am out o' friends, madam; and I hope to have  
friends for my wife's sake.

**COUNTESS**  
Such friends are thine enemies, knave.

**Clown**  
You're shallow, madam, in great friends; for the  
knaves come to do that for me which I am aweary of.  
He that ears my land spares my team and gives me  
leave to in the crop; if I be his cuckold, he's my  
drudge: he that comforts my wife is the cherisher  
of my flesh and blood; he that cherishes my flesh  
and blood loves my flesh and blood; he that loves my  
flesh and blood is my friend: ergo, he that kisses  
my wife is my friend. If men could be contented to  
be what they are, there were no fear in marriage.

**COUNTESS**  
Wilt thou ever be a foul-mouthed and calumnious knave?  
Get you gone, sir; I'll talk with you more anon.

**Steward**  
May it please you, madam, that he bid Helen come to  
you: of her I am to speak.

**COUNTESS**  
Sirrah, tell my gentlewoman I would speak with her;  
Helen, I mean.

**Clown**  
Was this fair face the cause, quoth she,  
Why the Grecians sacked Troy?  
Among nine bad if one be good,  
There's yet one good in ten.

**COUNTESS**  
What, one good in ten?

**Clown**  
One good woman in ten, madam; One in ten, quoth a'! An we  
might have a good woman born but one every blazing  
star, or at an earthquake, 'twould mend the lottery  
well: a man may draw his heart out, ere a' pluck  
one.

**COUNTESS**  
You'll be gone, sir knave, and do as I command you.

**Clown**  
That man should be at woman's command, and yet no  
hurt done! Though honesty be no puritan, yet it  
will do no hurt; it will wear the surplice of  
humility over the black gown of a big heart. I am  
going, forsooth: the business is for Helen to come hither.

*Exit*

**COUNTESS**  
Well, now.

**Steward**  
I know, madam, you love your gentlewoman entirely.

**COUNTESS**  
Faith, I do: her father bequeathed her to me; and  
she herself, without other advantage, may lawfully  
make title to as much love as she finds: there is  
more owing her than is paid; and more shall be paid  
her than she'll demand.

**Steward**  
Madam, I was very late more near her than I think  
she wished me: alone she was, and did communicate  
to herself her own words to her own ears; she  
thought, I dare vow for her, they touched not any  
stranger sense. Her matter was, she loved your son:  
Fortune, she said, was no goddess, that had put  
such difference betwixt their two estates; Love no  
god, that would not extend his might, only where  
qualities were level; This she delivered in the most bitter touch of  
sorrow that e'er I heard virgin exclaim in: which I  
held my duty speedily to acquaint you withal;  
sithence, in the loss that may happen, it concerns  
you something to know it.

**COUNTESS**  
You have discharged this honestly; keep it to  
yourself: many likelihoods informed me of this  
before, which hung so tottering in the balance that  
I could neither believe nor misdoubt. Pray you,  
leave me: stall this in your bosom; and I thank you  
for your honest care: I will speak with you further anon.

*Exit Steward*

*Enter HELENA*

**HELENA**  
What is your pleasure, madam? ...

**COUNTESS**  
... You know, Helen,  
I am a mother to you.

**HELENA**  
Mine honorable mistress. ...

**COUNTESS**  
... Nay, a mother:  
Why not a mother? When I said 'a mother,'  
Methought you saw a serpent: what's in 'mother,'  
That you start at it? I say, I am your mother;  
And put you in the catalogue of those  
That were enwombed mine: 'tis often seen  
Adoption strives with nature and choice breeds  
A native slip to us from foreign seeds:  
You ne'er oppress'd me with a mother's groan,  
Yet I express to you a mother's care:  
God's mercy, maiden! does it curd thy blood  
To say I am thy mother? What's the matter,  
That this distemper'd messenger of wet,  
The many-color'd Iris, rounds thine eye?  
Why? that you are my daughter? ...

**HELENA**  
... That I am not.

**COUNTESS**  
I say, I am your mother. ...

**HELENA**  
... Pardon, madam;  
The Count Rousillon cannot be my brother:  
I am from humble, he from honor'd name;  
No note upon my parents, his all noble:  
My master, my dear lord he is; and I  
His servant live, and will his vassal die:  
He must not be my brother. ...

**COUNTESS**  
... Nor I your mother?

**HELENA**  
You are my mother, madam; would you were,--  
So that my lord your son were not my brother,--  
Indeed my mother! or were you both our mothers,  
I care no more for than I do for heaven,  
So I were not his sister. Can't no other,  
But, I your daughter, he must be my brother?

**COUNTESS**  
Yes, Helen, you might be my daughter-in-law:  
God shield you mean it not! daughter and mother  
So strive upon your pulse. What, pale again?  
My fear hath catch'd your fondness: now I see  
The mystery of your loneliness, and find  
Your salt tears' head: now to all sense 'tis gross  
You love my son; invention is ashamed,  
Against the proclamation of thy passion,  
To say thou dost not: therefore tell me true;  
But tell me then, 'tis so; for, look thy cheeks  
Confess it, th' one to th' other; and thine eyes  
See it so grossly shown in thy behaviors  
That in their kind they speak it: only sin  
And hellish obstinacy tie thy tongue,  
That truth should be suspected. Speak, is't so?  
Tell me truly. ...

**HELENA**  
... Good madam, pardon me!

**COUNTESS**  
Do you love my son? ...

**HELENA**  
... Do not you love him?

**COUNTESS**  
Go not about; my love hath in't a bond,  
Whereof the world takes note: come, come, disclose  
The state of your affection; for your passions  
Have to the full appeach'd. ...

**HELENA**  
... Then, I confess,  
Here on my knee, before high heaven and you,  
That before you, and next unto high heaven,  
I love your son.  
My friends were poor, but honest; so's my love:  
Be not offended; for it hurts not him  
That he is loved of me: I follow him not  
By any token of presumptuous suit;  
Nor would I have him till I do deserve him;  
Yet never know how that desert should be.  
I know I love in vain, strive against hope;  
Yet in this captious and intenible sieve  
I still pour in the waters of my love  
And lack not to lose still: dearest madam,  
Let not your hate encounter with my love  
For loving where you do: but if yourself,  
Whose aged honor cites a virtuous youth,  
Did ever in so true a flame of liking  
Wish chastely and love dearly, give pity  
To her, whose state is such that cannot choose  
But lend and give where she is sure to lose;  
That seeks not to find that her search implies,  
But riddle-like lives sweetly where she dies!

**COUNTESS**  
Had you not lately an intent,--speak truly,--  
To go to Paris? ...

**HELENA**  
... Madam, I had. ...

**COUNTESS**  
... Wherefore? Tell true.

**HELENA**  
You know my father left me some prescriptions  
Of rare and proved effects; amongst them all  
There is a remedy, approved, set down,  
To cure the desperate languishings whereof  
The king is render'd lost. ...

**COUNTESS**  
... This was your motive  
For Paris, was it? speak.

**HELENA**  
My lord your son made me to think of this;  
Else Paris and the medicine and the king  
Had from the conversation of my thoughts  
Haply been absent then. ...

**COUNTESS**  
... But think you, Helen,  
If you should tender your supposed aid,  
He would receive it? he and his physicians  
Are of a mind; he, that they cannot help him,  
They, that they cannot help: how shall they credit  
A poor unlearned virgin, when the schools,  
Embowell'd of their doctrine, have left off  
The danger to itself? ...

**HELENA**  
... There's something in't,  
More than my father's skill, which was the greatest  
Of his profession, that his good receipt  
Shall for my legacy be sanctified  
By the luckiest stars in heaven: and, would your honor  
But give me leave to try success, I'd venture  
The well-lost life of mine on his grace's cure  
By such a day and hour. ...

**COUNTESS**  
... Dost thou believe't?

**HELENA**  
Ay, madam, knowingly.

**COUNTESS**  
Why, Helen, thou shalt have my leave and love,  
Means and attendants and my loving greetings  
To those of mine in court: I'll stay at home  
And pray God's blessing into thy attempt:  
Be gone tomorrow; and be sure of this,  
What I can help thee to thou shalt not miss.

*Exeunt*

## ACT II

### SCENE I. Paris. The KING's palace.

*Flourish of cornets. Enter the KING, attended with BERTRAM, PAROLLES, and Two Lords*

**KING**  
Farewell, young lords; these warlike principles  
Do not throw from you: and you, my lords, farewell:  
Share the advice betwixt you; if both gain, all  
The gift doth stretch itself as 'tis received,  
And is enough for both. ...

**First Lord**  
... 'Tis our hope, sir,  
After well enter'd soldiers, to return  
And find your grace in health.

**KING**  
No, no, it cannot be; and yet my heart  
Will not confess he owes the malady  
That doth my life besiege. Farewell, young lords;  
Whether I live or die, be you the sons  
Of worthy Frenchmen: let higher Italy,--  
Those bated that inherit but the fall  
Of the last monarchy,--see that you come  
Not to woo honor, but to wed it; when  
The bravest questant shrinks, find what you seek,  
That fame may cry you loud: I say, farewell.

*Exit*

**First Lord**  
O, my sweet lord, that you will stay behind us!

**PAROLLES**  
'Tis not his fault, the spark. ...

**Second Lord**  
... O, 'tis brave wars!

**PAROLLES**  
Most admirable: I have seen those wars.

**BERTRAM**  
I am commanded here, and kept a coil with  
'Too young' and 'the next year' and ''tis too early.'

**PAROLLES**  
An thy mind stand to't, boy, steal away bravely.

**BERTRAM**  
I shall stay here the forehorse to a smock,  
Creaking my shoes on the plain masonry,  
Till honor be bought up and no sword worn  
But one to dance with! By heaven, I'll steal away.

**Second Lord**  
I am your accessary; and so, farewell.

**BERTRAM**  
I grow to you, and our parting is a tortured body.

**First Lord**  
Farewell, captain.

**Second Lord**  
Sweet Monsieur Parolles!

**PAROLLES**  
Noble heroes, my sword and yours are kin.

*Exeunt Lords*

**PAROLLES**  
Mars dote on you for his novices! what will ye do?

**BERTRAM**  
Stay: the king.

*Re-enter KING. BERTRAM and PAROLLES retire*

**PAROLLES**  
*\[To BERTRAM]*  
Use a more spacious ceremony to the  
noble lords; you have restrained yourself within the  
list of too cold an adieu: be more expressive to  
them: for they wear themselves in the cap of the  
time, there do muster true gait, eat, speak, and  
move under the influence of the most received star;  
and though the devil lead the measure, such are to  
be followed: after them, and take a more dilated farewell.

**BERTRAM**  
And I will do so.

**PAROLLES**  
Worthy fellows; and like to prove most sinewy sword-men.

*Exeunt BERTRAM and PAROLLES*

*Enter LAFEU*

**LAFEU**  
*\[Kneeling]*  
Pardon, my lord, for me and for my tidings.

**KING**  
I'll fee thee to stand up.

**LAFEU**  
They, my good lord, are thus; will you be cured
Of your infirmity? ...

**KING**  
... No. ...

**LAFEU**  
... O, will you eat  
No grapes, my royal fox? Yes, but you will
My noble grapes, an if my royal fox
Could reach them: I have seen a medicine  
That's able to breathe life into a stone,  
With spritely fire and motion; whose simple touch,  
Is powerful to araise King Pepin, nay,  
To give great Charlemain a pen in's hand,  
And write to her a love-line. ...

**KING**  
... What 'her' is this?

**LAFEU**  
Why, Doctor She: my lord, there's one arrived,  
If you will see her: now, who hath amazed me more  
Than I dare blame my weakness: will you see her,  
For that is her demand, and know her business?  
That done, laugh well at me. ...

**KING**  
... Now, good Lafeu,  
Bring in the admiration; that we with thee  
May spend our wonder too, or take off thine  
By wondering how thou took'st it.

*Exit LAFEU*

Thus he his special nothing ever prologues.

*Re-enter LAFEU, with HELENA*

**LAFEU**  
Nay, come your ways.  
This is his majesty; say your mind to him.

*Exit*

**KING**  
Now, fair one, does your business follow us?

**HELENA**  
Ay, my good lord.  
Gerard de Narbon was my father;  
In what he did profess, well found. ...

**KING**  
... I knew him.

**HELENA**  
The rather will I spare my praises towards him:  
Knowing him is enough. On's bed of death  
Many receipts he gave me: chiefly one.  
Which, as the dearest issue of his practice,  
He bade me store up, as a triple eye,  
Safer than mine own two, more dear; I have so;  
And hearing your high majesty is touch'd  
With that malignant cause wherein the honor  
Of my dear father's gift stands chief in power,  
I come to tender it and my appliance  
With all bound humbleness. ...

**KING**  
... We thank you, maiden;  
But may not be so credulous of cure,  
When our most learned doctors leave us and  
The congregated college have concluded  
That laboring art can never ransom nature  
From her inaidible estate; I say we must not  
So stain our judgment, or corrupt our hope.

**HELENA**  
My duty then shall pay me for my pains:  
I will no more enforce mine office on you.  
Humbly entreating from your royal thoughts  
A modest one, to bear me back again.

**KING**  
I cannot give thee less, to be call'd grateful:  
Thou thought'st to help me; and such thanks I give  
As one near death to those that wish him live:  
But what at full I know, thou know'st no part,  
I knowing all my peril, thou no art.

**HELENA**  
What I can do can do no hurt to try,  
Since you set up your rest 'gainst remedy.  
He that of greatest works is finisher  
Oft does them by the weakest minister.

**KING**  
I must not hear thee; fare thee well, kind maid;  
Thy pains not used must by thyself be paid:  
Proffers not took reap thanks for their reward.

**HELENA**  
Inspired merit so by breath is barr'd:  
It is not so with Him that all things knows  
As 'tis with us that square our guess by shows;  
But most it is presumption in us when  
The help of heaven we count the act of men.  
Dear sir, to my endeavors give consent;  
Of heaven, not me, make an experiment.  
I am not an impostor that proclaim  
Myself against the level of mine aim;  
But know I think and think I know most sure  
My art is not past power nor you past cure.

**KING**  
Are thou so confident? within what space  
Hopest thou my cure? ...

**HELENA**  
... The great'st grace lending grace  
Ere twice the horses of the sun shall bring  
Their fiery torcher his diurnal ring,  
What is infirm from your sound parts shall fly,  
Health shall live free and sickness freely die.

**KING**  
Upon thy certainty and confidence  
What darest thou venture? ...

**HELENA**  
... Tax of impudence,  
A strumpet's boldness, a divulged shame  
Traduced by odious ballads: my maiden's name  
Sear'd otherwise; nay, worse--if worse--extended  
With vilest torture let my life be ended.

**KING**  
Methinks in thee some blessed spirit doth speak  
His powerful sound within an organ weak:  
Thy life is dear; for all that life can rate  
Worth name of life in thee hath estimate:  
Thou this to hazard needs must intimate  
Skill infinite or monstrous desperate.  
Sweet practiser, thy physic I will try,  
That ministers thine own death if I die.

**HELENA**  
If I break time, or flinch in property  
Of what I spoke, unpitied let me die,  
And well deserved: not helping, death's my fee;  
But, if I help, what do you promise me?

**KING**  
Make thy demand. ...

**HELENA**  
... But will you make it even?

**KING**  
Ay, by my scepter and my hopes of heaven.

**HELENA**  
Then shalt thou give me with thy kingly hand  
What husband in thy power I will command:  
Exempted be from me the arrogance  
To choose from forth the royal blood of France,  
My low and humble name to propagate  
With any branch or image of thy state;  
But such a one, thy vassal, whom I know  
Is free for me to ask, thee to bestow.

**KING**  
Here is my hand; the premises observed,  
Thy will by my performance shall be served:  
Give me some help here, ho! If thou proceed  
As high as word, my deed shall match thy meed.

*Flourish. Exeunt*

### SCENE II. Rousillon. The COUNT's palace.

*Enter COUNTESS and Clown*

**COUNTESS**  
Come on, sir; I shall now put you to the height of  
your breeding.

**Clown**  
I will show myself highly fed and lowly taught: I  
know my business is but to the court.

**COUNTESS**  
To the court?! why, what place make you special,  
when you put off that with such contempt? But to the court!

**Clown**  
Truly, madam, if God have lent a man any manners, he  
may easily put it off at court: but for me, I have an answer  
will serve all men.

**COUNTESS**  
Marry, that's a bountiful answer that fits all  
questions.

**Clown**  
It is like a barber's chair that fits all buttocks,  
the pin-buttock, the quatch-buttock, the brawn  
buttock, or any buttock.

**COUNTESS**  
Will your answer serve fit to all questions?

**Clown**  
As fit as ten groats is for the hand of an attorney.

**COUNTESS**  
Have you, I say, an answer of such fitness for all  
questions?

**Clown**  
From below your duke to beneath your constable, it  
will fit any question.

**COUNTESS**  
It must be an answer of most monstrous size that  
must fit all demands.

**Clown**  
But a trifle neither, in good faith, if the learned  
should speak truth of it: here it is, and all that  
belongs to't. Ask me if I am a courtier: it shall  
do you no harm to learn.

**COUNTESS**  
To be young again, if we could: I will be a fool in  
question, hoping to be the wiser by your answer. I  
pray you, sir, are you a courtier?

**Clown**  
O Lord, sir! There's a simple putting off. More,  
more, a hundred of them.

**COUNTESS**  
Sir, I am a poor friend of yours, that loves you.

**Clown**  
O Lord, sir! Thick, thick, spare not me.

**COUNTESS**  
Do you cry, 'O Lord, sir!' at your whipping, and  
'spare not me?' Indeed your 'O Lord, sir!' is very  
sequent to your whipping: you would answer very well  
to a whipping, if you were but bound to't.

**Clown**  
I ne'er had worse luck in my life in my 'O Lord,  
sir!' I see things may serve long, but not serve ever.

**COUNTESS**  
I play the noble housewife with the time  
To entertain't so merrily with a fool.

**Clown**  
O Lord, sir! why, there't serves well again.

**COUNTESS**  
An end, sir; to your business. Give Helen this,  
And urge her to a present answer back:  
Commend me to my kinsmen and my son:  
This is not much.

**Clown**  
Not much commendation to them.

**COUNTESS**  
Not much employment for you: you understand me?

**Clown**  
Most fruitfully: I am there before my legs.

**COUNTESS**  
Haste you again.

*Exeunt severally*

### SCENE III. Paris. The KING's palace.

*Enter BERTRAM, LAFEU, and PAROLLES*

*Enter KING, and HELENA. LAFEU and PAROLLES retire*

**KING**  
Go, call before me all the lords in court.  
Sit, my preserver, by thy patient's side;  
And with this healthful hand, whose banish'd sense  
Thou hast repeal'd, a second time receive  
The confirmation of my promised gift,  
Which but attends thy naming.

*Enter three Lords*

Fair maid, send forth thine eye: this youthful parcel  
Of noble bachelors stand at my bestowing,  
O'er whom both sovereign power and father's voice  
I have to use: thy frank election make;  
Thou hast power to choose, and they none to forsake.

**HELENA**  
To each of you one fair and virtuous mistress  
Fall, when Love please! marry, to each, but one!

**KING**  
Not one of those but had a noble father.

**HELENA**  
Gentlemen,  
Heaven hath through me restored the king to health.  
I am a simple maid, and therein wealthiest,  
That I protest I simply am a maid.  
Please it your majesty, I have done already:  
The blushes in my cheeks thus whisper me,  
'We blush that thou shouldst choose; but, be refused,  
Let the white death sit on thy cheek forever;  
We'll ne'er come there again.' ...

**KING**  
... Make choice; and, see,  
Who shuns thy love shuns all his love in me.

**HELENA**  
Sir, will you hear my suit?

**Third Lord**  
And grant it. ...

**HELENA**  
... Thanks, sir; all the rest is mute.

**LAFEU**  
I had rather be in this choice than throw ames-ace for my life.

**HELENA**  
The honor, sir, that flames in your fair eyes,  
Before I speak, too threateningly replies:  
Love make your fortunes twenty times above  
Her that so wishes and her humble love!

**Fourth Lord**  
No better, if you please. ...

**HELENA**  
... My wish receive,  
Which great Love grant! and so, I take my leave.

**LAFEU**  
Do all they deny her? An they were sons of mine,  
I'd have them whipped; or I would send them to the  
Turk, to make eunuchs of.

**HELENA**  
You are too young, too happy, and too good,  
To make yourself a son out of my blood.

**Fifth Lord**  
Fair one, I think not so.

**HELENA**  
*\[To BERTRAM]*  
I dare not say I take you; but I give  
Me and my service, ever whilst I live,  
Into your guiding power. This is the man.

**KING**  
Why, then, young Bertram, take her; she's thy wife.

**BERTRAM**  
My wife, my liege! I shall beseech your highness,  
In such a business give me leave to use  
The help of mine own eyes. ...

**KING**  
... Know'st thou not, Bertram,  
What she has done for me? ...

**BERTRAM**  
... Yes, my good lord;  
But never hope to know why I should marry her.

**KING**  
Thou know'st she has raised me from my sickly bed.

**BERTRAM**  
But follows it, my lord, to bring me down  
Must answer for your raising? I know her well:  
She had her breeding at my father's charge.  
A poor physician's daughter my wife! Disdain  
Rather corrupt me ever!

**KING**  
'Tis only title thou disdain'st in her, the which  
I can build up. Strange is it that our bloods,  
Of color, weight, and heat, pour'd all together,  
Would quite confound distinction, yet stand off  
In differences so mighty. If she be  
All that is virtuous, save what thou dislikest,  
A poor physician's daughter, thou dislikest  
Of virtue for the name: but do not so:  
From lowest place when virtuous things proceed,  
The place is dignified by the doer's deed:  
The property by what it is should go,  
Not by the title. She is young, wise, fair;  
In these to nature she's immediate heir,  
And these breed honor: What should be said?  
If thou canst like this creature as a maid,  
I can create the rest: virtue and she  
Is her own dower; honor and wealth from me.

**BERTRAM**  
I cannot love her, nor will strive to do't.

**KING**  
Thou wrong'st thyself, if thou shouldst strive to choose.

**HELENA**  
That you are well restored, my lord, I'm glad:  
Let the rest go.

**KING**  
My honor's at the stake; which to defeat,  
I must produce my power. Here, take her hand,  
Proud scornful boy, unworthy this good gift;  
That dost in vile misprision shackle up  
My love and her desert; that canst not dream,  
We, poising us in her defective scale,  
Shall weigh thee to the beam; that wilt not know,  
It is in us to plant thine honor where  
We please to have it grow. Check thy contempt:  
Obey our will, which travails in thy good:  
Or I will throw thee from my care forever  
Into the staggers and the careless lapse  
Of youth and ignorance; Speak; thine answer.

**BERTRAM**  
Pardon, my gracious lord; for I submit  
My fancy to your eyes: when I consider  
What great creation and what dole of honor  
Flies where you bid it, I find that she, which late  
Was in my nobler thoughts most base, is now  
The praised of the king; who, so ennobled,  
Is as 'twere born so. ...

**KING**  
... Take her by the hand,  
And tell her she is thine: to whom I promise  
A counterpoise, if not to thy estate  
A balance more replete. ...

**BERTRAM**  
... I take her hand.

**KING**  
Good fortune and the favor of the king  
Smile upon this contract; whose ceremony  
Shall seem expedient on the now-born brief,  
And be perform'd tonight: the solemn feast  
Shall more attend upon the coming space,  
Expecting absent friends. As thou lovest her,  
Thy love's to me religious; else, does err.

*Exeunt all but LAFEU and PAROLLES*

**LAFEU**  
*\[Advancing]*  
Do you hear, monsieur? a word with you.

**PAROLLES**  
Your pleasure, sir?

**LAFEU**  
Your lord and master did well to make his  
recantation.

**PAROLLES**  
Recantation? My lord? my master!?

**LAFEU**  
Ay; is it not a language I speak?

**PAROLLES**  
A most harsh one, and not to be understood without  
bloody succeeding. My master!

**LAFEU**  
I did think thee, for two ordinaries, to be a pretty  
wise fellow; thou didst make tolerable vent of thy  
travel; it might pass: yet the scarfs and the  
bannerets about thee did manifoldly dissuade me from  
believing thee a vessel of too great a burthen.

**PAROLLES**  
Hadst thou not the privilege of antiquity upon thee,--

**LAFEU**  
Do not plunge thyself too far in anger, lest thou  
hasten thy trial.

**PAROLLES**  
My lord, you give me most egregious indignity.

**LAFEU**  
Ay, with all my heart; and thou art worthy of it.

**PAROLLES**  
I have not, my lord, deserved it.

**LAFEU**  
Yes, good faith, every dram of it; and I will not  
bate thee a scruple.

**PAROLLES**  
Well, I shall be wiser.

**LAFEU**  
Even as soon as thou canst, for thou hast to pull at  
a smack o' the contrary. If ever thou be'st bound  
in thy scarf and beaten, thou shalt find what it is  
to be proud of thy bondage. I have a desire to hold  
my acquaintance with thee, or rather my knowledge,  
that I may say in the default, he is a man I know.

**PAROLLES**  
My lord, you do me most insupportable vexation.

**LAFEU**  
I would it were hell-pains for thy sake, and my poor  
doing eternal: for doing I am past: as I will by  
thee, in what motion age will give me leave.

*Exit*

**PAROLLES**  
Well, thou hast a son shall take this disgrace off  
me; scurvy, old, filthy, scurvy lord! Well, I must  
be patient; there is no fettering of authority.  
I'll beat him, by my life, if I can meet him with  
any convenience, an he were double and double a  
lord. I'll have no more pity of his age than I  
would of--I'll beat him, an if I could but meet him again.

*Re-enter LAFEU*

**LAFEU**  
Sirrah, your lord and master's married; there's news  
for you: you have a new mistress.

**PAROLLES**  
I most unfeignedly beseech your lordship to make  
some reservation of your wrongs: he is my good  
lord: whom I serve above is my master.

**LAFEU**  
Who? God?

**PAROLLES**  
Ay, sir.

**LAFEU**  
The devil it is that's thy master. Why dost thou  
garter up thy arms o' this fashion? dost make hose of  
sleeves? do other servants so? Thou wert best set  
thy lower part where thy nose stands. I think thou wast  
created for men to breathe themselves upon thee.

**PAROLLES**  
This is hard and undeserved measure, my lord.

**LAFEU**  
Go to, sir; you were beaten in Italy for picking a  
kernel out of a pomegranate; you are a vagabond and  
no true traveler: you are more saucy with lords  
and honorable personages than the commission of your  
birth and virtue gives you heraldry. You are not  
worth another word, else I'd call you knave. I leave you.

*Exit*

**PAROLLES**  
Good, very good; it is so then: good, very good;  
let it be concealed awhile.

*Re-enter BERTRAM*

**BERTRAM**  
Undone, and forfeited to cares forever!

**PAROLLES**  
What's the matter, sweet-heart?

**BERTRAM**  
Although before the solemn priest I have sworn,  
I will not bed her.

**PAROLLES**  
What, what, sweet-heart?

**BERTRAM**  
O my Parolles, they have married me!  
I'll to the Tuscan wars, and never bed her.

**PAROLLES**  
France is a dog-hole, and it no more merits  
The tread of a man's foot: to the wars!

**BERTRAM**  
There's letters from my mother: what the import is,  
I know not yet.

**PAROLLES**  
Ay, that would be known. To the wars, my boy, to the wars!

**BERTRAM**  
It shall be so: I'll send her to my house,  
Acquaint my mother with my hate to her,  
And wherefore I am fled; write to the king  
That which I durst not speak; his present gift  
Shall furnish me to those Italian fields,  
Where noble fellows strike: war is no strife  
To the dark house and the detested wife.

**PAROLLES**  
Will this capriccio hold in thee? art sure?

**BERTRAM**  
Go with me to my chamber, and advise me.  
I'll send her straight away: tomorrow  
I'll to the wars, she to her single sorrow.

*Exeunt*

### SCENE IV. Paris. The KING's palace.

*Enter HELENA and Clown*

**HELENA**  
My mother greets me kindly; is she well?

**Clown**  
She is not well; but yet she has her health: she's  
very merry; but yet she is not well: but thanks be  
given, she's very well and wants nothing i' the  
world; but yet she is not well.

**HELENA**  
If she be very well, what does she ail, that she's  
not very well?

**Clown**  
Truly, she's very well indeed, but for two things.

**HELENA**  
What two things?

**Clown**  
One, that she's not in heaven, whither God send her  
quickly! the other that she's in earth, from whence  
God send her quickly!

*Enter PAROLLES*

**PAROLLES**  
Bless you, my fortunate lady!

**HELENA**  
I hope, sir, I have your good will to have mine own  
good fortunes.

**PAROLLES**  
You had my prayers to lead them on; and to keep them  
on, have them still. O, my knave, how does my old lady?

**Clown**  
So that you had her wrinkles and I her money,  
I would she did as you say.

**PAROLLES**  
Why, I say nothing.

**Clown**  
Marry, you are the wiser man; for many a man's  
tongue shakes out his master's undoing: to say  
nothing, to do nothing, to know nothing, and to have  
nothing, is to be a great part of your title; which  
is within a very little of nothing.

**PAROLLES**  
Away! thou'rt a knave.

**Clown**  
You should have said, sir, before a knave thou'rt a  
knave; that's, before me thou'rt a knave: this had  
been truth, sir.

**PAROLLES**  
Go to, thou art a witty fool; I have found thee.

**Clown**  
Did you find me in yourself, sir? or were you  
taught to find me? The search, sir, was profitable;  
and much fool may you find in you, even to the  
world's pleasure and the increase of laughter.

**PAROLLES**  
A good knave, i' faith, and well fed.  
Madam, my lord will go away tonight;  
A very serious business calls on him.  
The great prerogative and rite of love,  
Which, as your due, time claims, he does acknowledge;  
But puts it off to a compell'd restraint;  
That you will take your instant leave o' the king  
And make this haste as your own good proceeding,  
Strengthen'd with what apology you think  
May make it probable need. ...

**HELENA**  
... What more commands he?

**PAROLLES**  
That, having this obtain'd, you presently  
Attend his further pleasure.

**HELENA**  
In every thing I wait upon his will.

**PAROLLES**  
I shall report it so.

*Exeunt*

### SCENE V. Paris. The KING's palace.

*Enter LAFEU and BERTRAM*

**LAFEU**  
But I hope your lordship thinks not him a soldier.

**BERTRAM**  
Yes, my lord, and of very valiant approof.

**LAFEU**  
You have it from his own deliverance.

**BERTRAM**  
And by other warranted testimony.

**LAFEU**  
Then my dial goes not true: I took this lark for a bunting.

**BERTRAM**  
I do assure you, my lord, he is very great in  
knowledge and accordingly valiant.

**LAFEU**  
I have then sinned against his experience and  
transgressed against his valor; and my state that  
way is dangerous, since I cannot yet find in my  
heart to repent. Here he comes: I pray you, make  
us friends; I will pursue the amity.

*Enter PAROLLES*

**BERTRAM**  
*\[Aside to PAROLLES]*  
Is she gone to the king?

**PAROLLES**  
She is.

**BERTRAM**  
Will she away tonight?

**PAROLLES**  
As you'll have her.

**BERTRAM**  
I have writ my letters, casketed my treasure,  
Given order for our horses; and tonight,  
When I should take possession of the bride,  
End ere I do begin.

**LAFEU**  
A good traveler is something at the latter end of a  
dinner; but one that lies three thirds and uses a  
known truth to pass a thousand nothings with, should  
be once heard and thrice beaten. God save you, captain.

**BERTRAM**  
Is there any unkindness between my lord and you, monsieur?

**PAROLLES**  
I know not how I have deserved to run into my lord's  
displeasure.

**LAFEU**  
You have made shift to run into 't, boots and spurs  
and all, like him that leaped into the custard; and  
out of it you'll run again, rather than suffer  
question for your residence.

**BERTRAM**  
It may be you have mistaken him, my lord.

**LAFEU**  
And shall do so ever, though I took him at 's  
prayers. Fare you well, my lord; and believe this  
of me, there can be no kernel in this light nut; the  
soul of this man is his clothes. Trust him not in  
matter of heavy consequence; I have kept of them  
tame, and know their natures. Farewell, monsieur.

*Exit*

**PAROLLES**  
An idle lord. I swear.

**BERTRAM**  
I think so.

**PAROLLES**  
Why, do you not know him?

**BERTRAM**  
Yes, I do know him well, and common speech  
Gives him a worthy pass. Here comes my clog.

*Enter HELENA*

**HELENA**  
I have, sir, as I was commanded from you,  
Spoke with the king and have procured his leave  
For present parting; only he desires  
Some private speech with you. ...

**BERTRAM**  
... I shall obey his will.  
You must not marvel, Helen, at my course,  
Which holds not color with the time, nor does  
The ministration and required office  
On my particular. Prepared I was not  
For such a business; therefore am I found  
So much unsettled: this drives me to entreat you  
That presently you take our way for home;  
And rather muse than ask why I entreat you,  
For my respects are better than they seem,  
And my appointments have in them a need  
Greater than shows itself at the first view  
To you that know them not. This to my mother:

*\[Giving a letter]*  
'Twill be two days ere I shall see you, so  
I leave you to your wisdom. ...

**HELENA**  
... Sir, I can nothing say,  
But that I am your most obedient servant.

**BERTRAM**  
Come, come, no more of that. ...

**HELENA**  
... And ever shall  
With true observance seek to eke out that  
Wherein toward me my homely stars have fail'd  
To equal my great fortune. ...

**BERTRAM**  
... Let that go:  
My haste is very great: farewell; hie home.

**HELENA**  
Pray, sir, your pardon. ...

**BERTRAM**  
... Well, what would you say?

**HELENA**  
I am not worthy of the wealth I owe,  
Nor dare I say 'tis mine, and yet it is;  
But, like a timorous thief, most fain would steal  
What law does vouch mine own. ...

**BERTRAM**  
... What would you have?

**HELENA**  
Something; and scarce so much: nothing, indeed.  
I would not tell you what I would, my lord:  
Faith yes;  
Strangers and foes do sunder, and not kiss.

**BERTRAM**  
I pray you, stay not, but in haste to horse.

**HELENA**  
I shall not break your bidding, good my lord.

**BERTRAM**  
Where are my other men, monsieur? Farewell.

*Exit HELENA*

Go thou toward home; where I will never come  
Whilst I can shake my sword or hear the drum.  
Away, and for our flight.

**PAROLLES**  
Bravely, coragio!

*Exeunt*

## ACT III

### SCENE II. Rousillon. The COUNT's palace.

*Enter COUNTESS and Clown*

**COUNTESS**  
It hath happened all as I would have had it, save  
that he comes not along with her. Let me see  
what he writes, and when he means to come.  
*\[Opening a letter]*

**Clown**  
I have no mind to Isbel since I was at court: our  
old ling and our Isbels o' the country are nothing  
like your old ling and your Isbels o' the court:  
the brains of my Cupid's knocked out, and I begin to  
love, as an old man loves money, with no stomach.

**COUNTESS**  
What have we here?

**Clown**  
E'en that you have there.

*Exit*

**COUNTESS**  
*\[Reads]*  
I have sent you a daughter-in-law: she hath  
recovered the king, and undone me. I have wedded  
her, not bedded her; and sworn to make the 'not'  
eternal. You shall hear I am run away: know it  
before the report come. If there be breadth enough  
in the world, I will hold a long distance. My duty  
to you. Your unfortunate son,  
BERTRAM.

This is not well, rash and unbridled boy.  
To fly the favors of so good a king!

*Re-enter Clown*

**Clown**  
O madam, yonder is heavy news within between two  
soldiers and my young lady!

**COUNTESS**  
What is the matter?

**Clown**  
Nay, there is some comfort in the news, some  
comfort; your son will not be killed so soon as I  
thought he would.

**COUNTESS**  
Why should he be killed?

**Clown**  
So say I, madam, if he run away, as I hear he does:  
the danger is in standing to't; that's the loss of  
men, though it be the getting of children. Here  
they come will tell you more: for my part, I only  
hear your son was run away.

*Exit*

*Enter HELENA, and the two French Lords*

**HELENA**  
Madam, my lord is gone, forever gone.

**COUNTESS**  
Think upon patience. Pray you, gentlemen,  
I have felt so many quirks of joy and grief,  
That the first face of neither, on the start,  
Can woman me unto't: where is my son, I pray you?

**First Lord**  
Madam, he's gone to serve the duke of Florence.

**HELENA**  
Look on his letter, madam; here's my passport.

*\[Reads]*  
When thou canst get the ring upon my finger which  
never shall come off, and show me a child begotten  
of thy body that I am father to, then call me  
husband: but in such a 'then' I write a 'never.'

This is a dreadful sentence.

**COUNTESS**  
I prithee, lady, have a better cheer;  
If thou engrossest all the griefs are thine,  
Thou robb'st me of a moiety: he was my son;  
But I do wash his name out of my blood,  
And thou art all my child. Towards Florence is he?

**First Lord**  
Ay, madam. ...

**COUNTESS**  
... And to be a soldier?

**First Lord**  
Such is his noble purpose; and believe 't,  
The duke will lay upon him all the honor  
That good convenience claims. ...

**COUNTESS**  
... Return you thither?

**Second Lord**  
Ay, madam, with the swiftest wing of speed.

**HELENA**  
*\[Reads]*  
Till I have no wife I have nothing in France.

'Tis bitter. ...

**COUNTESS**  
... Find you that there? ...

**HELENA**  
... Ay, madam.

**First Gentleman**  
'Tis but the boldness of his hand, haply,  
Which his heart was not consenting to.

**COUNTESS**  
Nothing in France, until he have no wife!  
There's nothing here that is too good for him  
But only she; and she deserves a lord  
That twenty such rude boys might tend upon  
And call her hourly mistress. Who was with him?

**Second Lord**  
A servant only, and a gentleman  
Which I have sometime known. ...

**COUNTESS**  
... Parolles, was it not?

**Second Lord**  
Ay, my good lady, he.

**COUNTESS**  
A very tainted fellow, and full of wickedness.  
My son corrupts a well-derived nature  
With his inducement. ...

**Second Lord**  
... Indeed, good lady.

**COUNTESS**  
I will entreat you, when you see my son,  
To tell him that his sword can never win  
The honor that he loses: more I'll entreat you  
Written to bear along. ...

**First Lord**  
... We serve you, madam,  
In that and all your worthiest affairs.

**COUNTESS**  
Not so, but as we change our courtesies.  
Will you draw near?

*Exeunt COUNTESS and Lords*

**HELENA**  
'Till I have no wife, I have nothing in France.'  
Nothing in France, until he has no wife!  
Thou shalt have none, Rousillon, none in France;  
Then hast thou all again. Poor lord! is't I  
That chase thee from thy country and expose  
Those tender limbs of thine to the event  
Of the none-sparing war? and is it I  
That drive thee from the sportive court, where thou  
Wast shot at with fair eyes, to be the mark  
Of smoky muskets? O you leaden messengers,  
That ride upon the violent speed of fire,  
Fly with false aim; move the still-peering air,  
That sings with piercing; do not touch my lord.  
Whoever shoots at him, I set him there;  
Whoever charges on his forward breast,  
I am the caitiff that do hold him to't;  
And, though I kill him not, I am the cause  
His death was so effected: better 'twere  
I met the ravin lion when he roar'd  
With sharp constraint of hunger; better 'twere  
That all the miseries which nature owes  
Were mine at once. No, come thou home, Rousillon,  
Whence honor but of danger wins a scar,  
As oft it loses all: I will be gone;  
My being here it is that holds thee hence:  
Shall I stay here to do't? no, no, although  
The air of paradise did fan the house  
And angels officed all: I will be gone,  
That pitiful rumor may report my flight,  
To consolate thine ear. Come, night; end, day!  
For with the dark, poor thief, I'll steal away.

*Exit*

### SCENE IV. Rousillon. The COUNT's palace.

*Enter COUNTESS and Steward*

**COUNTESS**  
Alas! and would you take the letter of her?  
Might you not know she would do as she has done,  
By sending me a letter? Read it again.

**Steward**  
*\[Reads]*  
I am Saint Jaques' pilgrim, thither gone:  
Ambitious love hath so in me offended,  
That barefoot plod I the cold ground upon,  
With sainted vow my faults to have amended.  
Write, write, that from the bloody course of war  
My dearest master, your dear son, may hie:  
Bless him at home in peace, whilst I from far  
His name with zealous fervor sanctify:  
His taken labors bid him me forgive;  
He is too good and fair for death and me:  
Whom I myself embrace, to set him free.

**COUNTESS**  
Ah, what sharp stings are in her mildest words!  
Rinaldo, you did never lack advice so much,  
As letting her pass so: had I spoke with her,  
I could have well diverted her intents,  
Which thus she hath prevented. ...

**Steward**  
... Pardon me, madam:  
If I had given you this at over-night,  
She might have been o'erta'en; and yet she writes,  
Pursuit would be but vain. ...

**COUNTESS**  
... What angel shall  
Bless this unworthy husband? he cannot thrive,  
Unless her prayers, whom heaven delights to hear  
And loves to grant, reprieve him from the wrath  
Of greatest justice. Write, write, Rinaldo,  
To this unworthy husband of his wife;  
Let every word weigh heavy of her worth  
That he does weigh too light: my greatest grief.  
Though little he do feel it, set down sharply.  
Dispatch the most convenient messenger:  
When haply he shall hear that she is gone,  
He will return; and hope I may that she,  
Hearing so much, will speed her foot again,  
Led hither by pure love: which of them both  
Is dearest to me. I have no skill in sense  
To make distinction: provide this messenger:  
My heart is heavy and mine age is weak;  
Grief would have tears, and sorrow bids me speak.

*Exeunt*

## INTERMISSION

### SCENE V. Florence. Without the walls. A tucket afar off.

*Enter an old Widow of Florence, DIANA, and MARIANA.*

**Widow**  
Nay, come; for if they do approach the city, we  
shall lose all the sight.

**DIANA**  
They say the French count has done most honorable service.

**Widow**  
It is reported that he has taken their greatest  
commander; and that with his own hand he slew the  
duke's brother.

*Tucket*

We have lost our labor; they are gone a contrary  
way: hark! you may know by their trumpets.

**MARIANA**  
Come, let's return again, and suffice ourselves with  
the report of it. Well, Diana, take heed of this  
French earl: the honor of a maid is her name; and  
no legacy is so rich as honesty.

**Widow**  
I have told my neighbor how you have been solicited  
by a gentleman his companion.

**MARIANA**  
I know that knave; hang him! one Parolles: a  
filthy officer he is in those suggestions for the  
young earl. Beware of them, Diana; their promises,  
enticements, oaths, tokens, and all these engines of  
lust, are not the things they go under: many a maid  
hath been seduced by them; and the misery is,  
example, that so terrible shows in the wreck of  
maidenhood, cannot for all that dissuade succession,  
but that they are limed with the twigs that threaten  
them.

**DIANA**  
You shall not need to fear me.

**Widow**  
I hope so.

*Enter HELENA, disguised like a Pilgrim*

Look, here comes a pilgrim: I know she will lie at  
my house; thither they send one another: I'll  
question her. God save you, pilgrim! whither are you bound?

**HELENA**  
To Saint Jaques le Grand.  
Where do the palmers lodge, I do beseech you?

**Widow**  
At the Saint Francis here beside the port.

**HELENA**  
Is this the way?

**Widow**  
Ay, marry, is't. ...

*A march afar*

... Hark you! they come this way.  
If you will tarry, holy pilgrim,  
But till the troops come by,  
I will conduct you where you shall be lodged;  
The rather, for I think I know your hostess  
As ample as myself. ...

**HELENA**  
... Is it yourself?

**Widow**  
If you shall please so, pilgrim.

**HELENA**  
I thank you, and will stay upon your leisure.

**Widow**  
You came, I think, from France? ...

**HELENA**  
... I did so.

**Widow**  
Here you shall see a countryman of yours  
That has done worthy service. ...

**HELENA**  
... His name, I pray you.

**DIANA**  
The Count Rousillon: know you such a one?

**HELENA**  
But by the ear, that hears most nobly of him:  
His face I know not. ...

**DIANA**  
... Whatsome'er he is,  
He's bravely taken here. He stole from France,  
As 'tis reported, for the king had married him  
Against his liking: think you it is so?

**HELENA**  
Ay, surely, mere the truth: I know his lady.

**DIANA**  
There is a gentleman that serves the count  
Reports but coarsely of her. ...

**HELENA**  
... What's his name?

**DIANA**  
Monsieur Parolles. ...

**HELENA**  
... O, I believe with him,  
In argument of praise, or to the worth  
Of the great count himself, she is too mean  
To have her name repeated: all her deserving  
Is a reserved honesty, and that  
I have not heard examined. ...

**DIANA**  
... Alas, poor lady!  
'Tis a hard bondage to become the wife  
Of a detesting lord.

**Widow**  
I warrant, good creature, wheresoe'er she is,  
Her heart weighs sadly: this young maid might do her  
A shrewd turn, if she pleased. ...

**HELENA**  
... How do you mean?  
May be the amorous count solicits her  
In the unlawful purpose. ...

**Widow**  
... He does indeed;  
And brokes with all that can in such a suit  
Corrupt the tender honor of a maid:  
But she is arm'd for him and keeps her guard  
In honestest defense. ...

**MARIANA**  
... The gods forbid else!

**Widow**  
So, now they come:

*Drum and Colors*

*Enter BERTRAM and PAROLLES*

That is Antonio, the duke's eldest son;  
That, Escalus. ...

**HELENA**  
... Which is the Frenchman? ...

**DIANA**  
... He;  
That with the plume: 'tis a most gallant fellow.  
I would he loved his wife: if he were honester  
He were much goodlier: is't not a handsome gentleman?

**HELENA**  
I like him well.

**DIANA**  
'Tis pity he is not honest: yond's that same knave  
That leads him to these places: were I his lady,  
I would poison that vile rascal. ...

**HELENA**  
... Which is he?

**DIANA**  
That jack-an-apes with scarfs: why is he melancholy?

**HELENA**  
Perchance he's hurt i' the battle.

**PAROLLES**  
Lose our drum! well.

**MARIANA**  
He's shrewdly vexed at something: look, he has spied us.

**Widow**  
Marry, hang you!

**MARIANA**  
And your courtesy, for a ring-carrier!

*Exeunt BERTRAM and PAROLLES*

**Widow**  
The troop is past. Come, pilgrim, I will bring you  
Where you shall host: of enjoin'd penitents  
There's four or five, to great Saint Jaques bound,  
Already at my house. ...

**HELENA**  
... I humbly thank you:  
Please it this matron and this gentle maid  
To eat with us tonight, the charge and thanking  
Shall be for me; and, to requite you further,  
I will bestow some precepts of this virgin  
Worthy the note. ...

**BOTH**  
... We'll take your offer kindly.

*Exeunt*

### SCENE VI. Camp before Florence.

*Enter BERTRAM and the two French Lords*

**Second Lord**  
Nay, good my lord, put him to't; let him have his  
way.

**First Lord**  
If your lordship find him not a hilding, hold me no  
more in your respect.

**Second Lord**  
On my life, my lord, a bubble.

**BERTRAM**  
Do you think I am so far deceived in him?

**Second Lord**  
Believe it, my lord, in mine own direct knowledge,  
without any malice, but to speak of him as my  
kinsman, he's a most notable coward, an infinite and  
endless liar, an hourly promise-breaker, the owner  
of no one good quality worthy your lordship's  
entertainment.

**First Lord**  
It were fit you knew him; lest, reposing too far in  
his virtue, which he hath not, he might at some  
great and trusty business in a main danger fail you.

**BERTRAM**  
I would I knew in what particular action to try him.

**Second Lord**  
I, with a troop of Florentines, will suddenly  
surprise him; such I will have, whom I am sure he  
knows not from the enemy: we will bind and hoodwink  
him so, that he shall suppose no other but that he  
is carried into the leaguer of the adversaries, when  
we bring him to our own tents. Be but your lordship  
present at his examination: if he do not, for the  
promise of his life and in the highest compulsion of  
base fear, offer to betray you and deliver all the  
intelligence in his power against you, and that with  
the divine forfeit of his soul upon oath, never  
trust my judgment in anything.

**First Lord**  
O, for the love of laughter, let him fetch his drum;  
he says he has a stratagem for't: when your  
lordship sees the bottom of his success in't, and to  
what metal this counterfeit lump of ore will be  
melted, if you give him not John Drum's  
entertainment, your inclining cannot be removed.  
Here he comes.

*Enter PAROLLES*

**BERTRAM**  
How now, monsieur! this drum sticks sorely in your  
disposition.

**First Lord**  
A pox on't, let it go; 'tis but a drum.

**PAROLLES**  
'But a drum'! is't 'but a drum'? A drum so lost!  
There was excellent command,--to charge in with our  
horse upon our own wings, and to rend our own soldiers!

**BERTRAM**  
Well, we cannot greatly condemn our success: some  
dishonor we had in the loss of that drum; but it is  
not to be recovered.

**PAROLLES**  
It might have been recovered.

**BERTRAM**  
It might; but it is not now.

**PAROLLES**  
It is to be recovered: but that the merit of  
service is seldom attributed to the true and exact  
performer, I would have that drum or another.

**BERTRAM**  
Why, if you have a stomach, to't, monsieur: if you  
think your mystery in stratagem can bring this  
instrument of honor again into his native quarter,  
be magnanimous in the enterprise and go on; I will  
grace the attempt for a worthy exploit: if you  
speed well in it, the duke shall both speak of it.

**PAROLLES**  
By the hand of a soldier, I will undertake it.

**BERTRAM**  
But you must not now slumber in it.

**PAROLLES**  
I'll about it this evening: and I will presently  
pen down my dilemmas, encourage myself in my  
certainty, put myself into my mortal preparation;  
and by midnight look to hear further from me.

**BERTRAM**  
May I be bold to acquaint his grace you are gone about it?

**PAROLLES**  
I know not what the success will be, my lord; but  
the attempt I vow.

**BERTRAM**  
I know thou'rt valiant; and, to the possibility of  
thy soldiership, will subscribe for thee. Farewell.

**PAROLLES**  
I love not many words.

*Exit*

**Second Lord**  
No more than a fish loves water.

**First Lord**  
You do not know him, my lord, as we do: certain it  
is that he will steal himself into a man's favor and  
for a week escape a great deal of discoveries; but  
when you find him out, you have him ever after.

**BERTRAM**  
Why, do you think he will make no deed at all of  
this that so seriously he does address himself unto?

**Second Lord**  
None in the world; but return with an invention and  
clap upon you two or three probable lies: but we  
have almost embossed him; you shall see his fall  
tonight; for indeed he is not for your lordship's respect.  
I must go look my twigs: he shall be caught.

**BERTRAM**  
Your brother he shall go along with me.

**Second Lord**  
As't please your lordship: I'll leave you.

*Exit*

**BERTRAM**  
Now will I lead you to the house, and show you  
The lass I spoke of. ...

**First Lord**  
... But you say she's honest.

**BERTRAM**  
That's all the fault: I spoke with her but once  
And found her wondrous cold; but I sent to her,  
By this same coxcomb that we have i' the wind,  
Tokens and letters which she did re-send;  
And this is all I have done. She's a fair creature:  
Will you go see her? ...

**First Lord**  
... With all my heart, my lord.

*Exeunt*

### SCENE VII. Florence. The Widow's house.

*Enter HELENA and Widow*

**HELENA**  
If you misdoubt me that I am not she,  
I know not how I shall assure you further,  
But I shall lose the grounds I work upon.

**Widow**  
Though my estate be fallen, I was well born,  
Nothing acquainted with these businesses;  
And would not put my reputation now  
In any staining act. ...

**HELENA**  
... Nor would I wish you.  
First, give me trust, the count he is my husband,  
And what to your sworn counsel I have spoken  
Is so from word to word; and then you cannot,  
By the good aid that I of you shall borrow,  
Err in bestowing it. ...

**Widow**  
... I should believe you:  
For you have show'd me that which well approves  
You're great in fortune. ...

**HELENA**  
... Take this purse of gold,  
And let me buy your friendly help thus far,  
Which I will over-pay and pay again  
When I have found it. The count he woos your daughter,  
Lays down his wanton siege before her beauty,  
Resolved to carry her: let her in fine consent,  
As we'll direct her how 'tis best to bear it.  
Now his important blood will nought deny  
That she'll demand: a ring the county wears,  
That downward hath succeeded in his house  
From son to son, some four or five descents  
Since the first father wore it: this ring he holds  
In most rich choice; yet in his idle fire,  
To buy his will, it would not seem too dear,  
Howe'er repented after. ...

**Widow**  
... Now I see  
The bottom of your purpose.

**HELENA**  
You see it lawful, then: it is no more,  
But that your daughter, ere she seems as won,  
Desires this ring; appoints him an encounter;  
In fine, delivers me to fill the time,  
Herself most chastely absent: after this,  
To marry her, I'll add three thousand crowns  
To what is passed already. ...

**Widow**  
... I have yielded:  
Instruct my daughter how she shall persever,  
That time and place with this deceit so lawful  
May prove coherent. Every night he comes  
With musics of all sorts and songs composed  
To her unworthiness: it nothing steads us  
To chide him from our eaves; for he persists  
As if his life lay on't. ...

**HELENA**  
... Why then tonight  
Let us assay our plot; which, if it speed,  
Is wicked meaning in a lawful deed  
And lawful meaning in a lawful act,  
Where both not sin, and yet a sinful fact.

*Exeunt*

## ACT IV

### SCENE I. Without the Florentine camp.

*Enter the Second French Lord, with four other Soldiers in ambush*

**Second Lord**  
He can come no other way but by this hedge-corner.  
When you sally upon him, speak what terrible  
language you will: though you understand it not  
yourselves, no matter; for we must not seem to  
understand him, unless someone among us whom we  
must produce for an interpreter.

**First Soldier**  
Good captain, let me be the interpreter.

**Second Lord**  
Art not acquainted with him? knows he not thy voice?

**First Soldier**  
No, sir, I warrant you.

**Second Lord**  
But what linsey-woolsey hast thou to speak to us again?

**First Soldier**  
E'en such as you speak to me.

**Second Lord**  
He must think us some band of strangers i' the  
adversary's entertainment. Now he hath a smack of  
all neighboring languages; therefore we must every  
one be a man of his own fancy, not to know what we  
speak one to another; so we seem to know, is to  
know straight our purpose: choughs' language,  
gabble enough, and good enough. As for you,  
interpreter, you must seem very politic. But couch,  
ho! here he comes, to beguile two hours in a sleep,  
and then to return and swear the lies he forges.

*Enter PAROLLES*

**PAROLLES**  
Ten o'clock: within these three hours 'twill be  
time enough to go home. What shall I say I have  
done? It must be a very plausive invention that  
carries it: they begin to smoke me; and disgraces  
have of late knocked too often at my door. I find  
my tongue is too foolhardy; but my heart hath the  
fear of Mars before it and of his creatures, not  
daring the reports of my tongue.

**Second Lord**  
*\[Aside]*  
This is the first truth that e'er thine own tongue  
was guilty of.

**PAROLLES**  
What the devil should move me to undertake the  
recovery of this drum, being not ignorant of the  
impossibility, and knowing I had no such purpose? I  
must give myself some hurts, and say I got them in  
exploit: yet slight ones will not carry it; they  
will say, 'Came you off with so little?' and great  
ones I dare not give. Wherefore, what's the  
instance? Tongue, I must put you into a  
butter-woman's mouth and buy myself another of  
Bajazet's mule, if you prattle me into these perils.

**Second Lord**  
*\[Aside]*  
Is it possible he should know what he is, and be  
that he is?

**PAROLLES**  
I would the cutting of my garments would serve the  
turn, or the breaking of my Spanish sword.

**Second Lord**  
*\[Aside]*  
We cannot afford you so.

**PAROLLES**  
Or the baring of my beard; and to say it was in  
stratagem.

**Second Lord**  
*\[Aside]*  
'Twould not do.

**PAROLLES**  
Or to drown my clothes, and say I was stripped.

**Second Lord**  
*\[Aside]*  
Hardly serve.

**PAROLLES**  
Though I swore I leaped from the window of the citadel.

**Second Lord**  
*\[Aside]*  
How deep?

**PAROLLES**  
Thirty fathom.

**Second Lord**  
*\[Aside]*  
Three great oaths would scarce make that be believed.

**PAROLLES**  
I would I had any drum of the enemy's: I would swear  
I recovered it.

**Second Lord**  
*\[Aside]*  
You shall hear one anon.

**PAROLLES**  
A drum now of the enemy's,--

*Alarum within*

**Second Lord**  
Throca movousus, cargo, cargo, cargo.

**PAROLLES**  
O, ransom, ransom! do not hide mine eyes.

*They seize and blindfold him*

**First Soldier**  
Boskos thromuldo boskos.

**PAROLLES**  
I know you are the Muskos' regiment:  
And I shall lose my life for want of language;  
If there be here German, or Dane, low Dutch,  
Italian, or French, let him speak to me; I'll  
Discover that which shall undo the Florentine.

**First Soldier**  
Boskos vauvado: I understand thee, and can speak  
thy tongue. Kerely bonto, sir, betake thee to thy  
faith, for seventeen poniards are at thy bosom.

**PAROLLES**  
O!

**First Soldier**  
O, pray, pray, pray! Manka revania dulche.

**Second Lord**  
Oscorbidulchos volivorco.

**First Soldier**  
The general is content to spare thee yet;

*\[Aside]*
And hoodwink'd as thou art, will lead thee on  
To gather from thee. ...

... Haply thou mayst inform  
Something to save thy life. ...

**PAROLLES**  
... O, let me live!  
And all the secrets of our camp I'll show,  
Their force, their purposes; nay, I'll speak that  
Which you will wonder at. ...

**First Soldier**  
... But wilt thou faithfully?

**PAROLLES**  
If I do not, damn me. ...

**First Soldier**  
... Acordo linta.  
Come on; thou art granted space.

*Exit, with PAROLLES guarded. A short alarum within*

**Second Lord**  
Go, tell the Count Rousillon, and my brother,  
We have caught the woodcock, and will keep him muffled  
Till we do hear from them.

*Exeunt*

### SCENE II. Florence. The Widow's house.

*Enter BERTRAM and DIANA*

**BERTRAM**  
They told me that your name was Fontibell.

**DIANA**  
No, my good lord, Diana. ...

**BERTRAM**  
... Titled goddess;  
And worth it, with addition! But, fair soul,  
In your fine frame hath love no quality?  
If quick fire of youth light not your mind,  
You are no maiden, but a monument:  
And now you should be as your mother was  
When your sweet self was got.

**DIANA**  
She then was honest. ...

**BERTRAM**  
... So should you be. ...

**DIANA**  
... No:  
My mother did but duty; such, my lord,  
As you owe to your wife. ...

**BERTRAM**  
... No more o' that;  
I prithee, do not strive against my vows:  
I was compell'd to her; but I love thee  
By love's own sweet constraint, and will forever  
Do thee all rights of service. ...

**DIANA**  
... Ay, so you serve us  
Till we serve you; but when you have our roses,  
You barely leave our thorns to prick ourselves  
And mock us with our bareness. ...

**BERTRAM**  
... How have I sworn!

**DIANA**  
'Tis not the many oaths that makes the truth,  
But the plain single vow that is vow'd true.  
What is not holy, that we swear not by,  
But take the High'st to witness: then, pray you, tell me,  
If I should swear by God's great attributes,  
I loved you dearly, would you believe my oaths,  
When I did love you ill? This has no holding,  
To swear by him whom I protest to love,  
That I will work against him: therefore your oaths  
Are words and poor conditions, but unseal'd,  
At least in my opinion. ...

**BERTRAM**  
... Change it!  Change it!
Be not so holy-cruel: love is holy;  
And my integrity ne'er knew the crafts  
That you do charge men with. Stand no more off,  
But give thyself unto my sick desires,  
Who then recover: say thou art mine, and ever  
My love as it begins shall so persever.

**DIANA**  
I see that men make ropes in such a scarre  
That we'll forsake ourselves. Give me that ring.

**BERTRAM**  
It is an honor 'longing to our house,  
Bequeathed down from many ancestors;  
Which were the greatest obloquy i' the world  
In me to lose. ...

**DIANA**  
... Mine honor's such a ring:  
My chastity's the jewel of our house,  
Bequeathed down from many ancestors;  
Which were the greatest obloquy i' the world  
In me to lose: thus your own proper wisdom  
Brings in the champion Honor on my part,  
Against your vain assault. ...

**BERTRAM**  
... Here, take my ring:  
My house, mine honor, yea, my life, be thine,  
And I'll be bid by thee.

**DIANA**  
When midnight comes, knock at my chamber-window:  
I'll order take my mother shall not hear.  
Now will I charge you in the band of truth,  
When you have conquer'd my yet maiden bed,  
Remain there but an hour, nor speak to me:  
My reasons are most strong; and you shall know them  
When back again this ring shall be deliver'd:  
And on your finger in the night I'll put  
Another ring, that what in time proceeds  
May token to the future our past deeds.  
Adieu, till then; then, fail not. You have won  
A wife of me, though there my hope be done.

**BERTRAM**  
A heaven on earth I have won by wooing thee.

*Exeunt*

### SCENE III. The Florentine camp.

*Enter the two French Lords*

**Second Lord**  
You have not given him his mother's letter?

**First Lord**  
I have delivered it an hour since: there is  
something in't that stings his nature; for on the  
reading it he changed almost into another man.

**Second Lord**  
He has much worthy blame laid upon him for shaking  
off so good a wife and so sweet a lady.

**First Lord**  
Especially he hath incurred the everlasting  
displeasure of the king, who had even tuned his  
bounty to sing happiness to him. I will tell you a  
thing, but you shall let it dwell darkly with you.  
He hath perverted a young gentlewoman here in  
Florence, of a most chaste renown; and this night he  
fleshes his will in the spoil of her honor: he hath  
given her his monumental ring, and thinks himself  
made in the unchaste composition.

**Second Lord**  
Now, God delay our rebellion! as we are ourselves,  
what things are we!

**First Lord**  
Merely our own traitors. And as in the common course  
of all treasons, we still see them reveal  
themselves, till they attain to their abhorred ends,  
so he that in this action contrives against his own  
nobility, in his proper stream o'erflows himself.

**Second Lord**  
Is it not meant damnable in us, to be trumpeters of  
our unlawful intents? We shall not then have his  
company tonight?

**First Lord**  
Not till after midnight; for he is dieted to his hour.

**Second Lord**  
That approaches apace; I would gladly have him see  
his company anatomized, that he might take a measure  
of his own judgments, wherein so curiously he had  
set this counterfeit.

**First Lord**  
We will not meddle with him till he come; for his  
presence must be the whip of the other.
In the mean time, what hear you of these wars?

**Second Lord**  
I hear there is an overture of peace.

**First Lord**  
Nay, I assure you, a peace concluded.

**Second Lord**  
What will Count Rousillon do then? will he travel  
higher, or return again into France?

**First Lord**  
I perceive, by this demand, you are not altogether  
of his council.

**Second Lord**  
Let it be forbid, sir; so should I be a great deal  
of his act.

**First Lord**  
Sir, his wife some two months since fled from his  
house: her pretense is a pilgrimage to Saint Jaques  
le Grand; which holy undertaking with most austere  
sanctimony she accomplished; and, there residing the  
tenderness of her nature became as a prey to her  
grief; in fine, made a groan of her last breath, and  
now she sings in heaven.

**Second Lord**  
How is this justified?

**First Lord**  
The stronger part of it by her own letters, which  
makes her story true, even to the point of her  
death: her death itself, which could not be her  
office to say is come, was faithfully confirmed by  
the rector of the place.

**Second Lord**  
Hath the count all this intelligence?

**First Lord**  
Ay, and the particular confirmations, point from  
point, so to the full arming of the verity.

**Second Lord**  
I am heartily sorry that he'll be glad of this.

*Enter a Servant*

How now! where's your master?

**Servant**  
He met the duke in the street, sir, of whom he hath  
taken a solemn leave: his lordship will next  
morning for France. The duke hath offered him  
letters of commendations to the king.

*Enter BERTRAM*

**Second Lord**  
How now, my lord! is't not after midnight?

**BERTRAM**  
I have tonight dispatched sixteen businesses, a  
month's length a-piece, by an abstract of success:  
I have congied with the duke, done my adieu with his  
nearest; buried a wife, mourned for her; writ to my  
lady mother I am returning; entertained my convoy;  
and between these main parcels of dispatch effected  
many nicer needs; the last was the greatest, but  
that I have not ended yet.

**Second Lord**  
If the business be of any difficulty, and this  
morning your departure hence, it requires haste of  
your lordship.

**BERTRAM**  
I mean, the business is not ended, as fearing to  
hear of it hereafter. But shall we have this  
dialogue between the fool and the soldier? Come,  
bring forth this counterfeit module, he has deceived  
me, like a double-meaning prophesier.

**Second Lord**  
Bring him forth: has sat i' the stocks all night,  
poor gallant knave.

*Exit First Lord*

**BERTRAM**  
No matter: his heels have deserved it, in usurping  
his spurs so long. How does he carry himself?

**Second Lord**  
I have told your lordship already, the stocks carry  
him. But to answer you as you would be understood;  
he weeps like a wench that had shed her milk: he  
hath confessed himself to Morgan, whom he supposes  
to be a friar, from the time of his remembrance to  
this very instant disaster of his setting i' the  
stocks: and what think you he hath confessed?

**BERTRAM**  
Nothing of me, has a'?

**Second Lord**  
His confession is taken, and it shall be read to his  
face: if your lordship be in't, as I believe you  
are, you must have the patience to hear it.

*Enter PAROLLES guarded by First Soldier and First Lord*

**BERTRAM**  
A plague upon him! muffled! he can say nothing of  
me: hush, hush!

**Second Lord**  
Hoodman comes! Portotartarosa.

**First Soldier**  
Our general bids you answer to what I shall ask you out of a note.

**PAROLLES**  
And truly, as I hope to live.

**First Soldier**  
*\[Reads]*  
'First demand of him how many horse the duke is strong.'

What say you to that?

**PAROLLES**  
Five or six thousand; but very weak and  
unserviceable: the troops are all scattered, and  
the commanders very poor rogues, upon my reputation  
and credit and as I hope to live.

**First Soldier**  
Shall I set down your answer so?

**PAROLLES**  
Do: I'll take the sacrament on't, how and which way you will.

**BERTRAM**  
*\[Apace, where PAROLLES cannot hear]*  
All's one to him. What a past-saving slave is this!

**Second Lord**  
I will never trust a man again for keeping his sword  
clean, nor believe he can have everything in him  
by wearing his apparel neatly.

**PAROLLES**  
*\[To First Soldier]*
Five or six thousand horse, I said,-- I will say  
true,--or thereabouts, set down, for I'll speak truth.

**First Lord**  
He's very near the truth in this.

**BERTRAM**  
But I con him no thanks for't, in the nature he  
delivers it.

**PAROLLES**  
*\[To First Soldier]*  
I humbly thank you, sir: a truth's a truth, the  
rogues are marvelous poor.

**First Soldier**  
*\[Reads]*  
'Demand of him, of what strength they are a-foot.'

What say you to that?

**PAROLLES**  
By my troth, sir, if I were to live this present  
hour, I will tell true. Let me see: the muster-file, rotten and  
sound, upon my life, amounts not to fifteen thousand  
poll; half of the which dare not shake snow from off  
their cassocks, lest they shake themselves to pieces.

**BERTRAM**  
What shall be done to him?

**First Lord**  
Nothing, but let him have thanks. Demand of him my  
condition, and what credit I have with the duke.

**First Soldier**  
Well, that's set down.

*\[Reads]*  
'You shall demand of him, whether one Captain Dumain  
be i' the camp, a Frenchman; what his reputation is  
with the duke; what his valor, honesty, and  
expertness in wars; or whether he thinks it were not  
possible, with well-weighing sums of gold, to  
corrupt him to revolt.' What say you to this? what  
do you know of it?

**PAROLLES**  
I beseech you, let me answer to the particular of  
the inter'gatories: demand them singly.  
I know him: a' was a botcher's 'prentice in Paris,  
from whence he was whipped for getting the shrieve's  
fool with child,--a dumb innocent, that could not  
say him nay.

**BERTRAM**  
Nay, by your leave, hold your hands; though I know  
his brains are forfeit to the next tile that falls.

**First Soldier**  
Well, is this captain in the duke of Florence's camp?

**PAROLLES**  
Upon my knowledge, he is, and lousy.  
The duke knows him for no other but a poor officer  
of mine; and writ to me this other day to turn him  
out o' the band: I think I have his letter in my pocket.

**First Soldier**  
Here 'tis; here's a paper: shall I read it to you?

*\[Reads]*  
'Dian, the count's a fool, and full of gold,'--

**PAROLLES**  
That is not the duke's letter, sir; that is an  
advertisement to a proper maid in Florence, one  
Diana, to take heed of the allurement of one Count  
Rousillon, a foolish idle boy, but for all that very  
ruttish: I pray you, sir, put it up again.

**First Soldier**  
Nay, I'll read it first, by your favor.

**PAROLLES**  
My meaning in't, I protest, was very honest in the  
behalf of the maid; for I knew the young count to be  
a dangerous and lascivious boy, who is a whale to  
virginity and devours up all the fry it finds.

**BERTRAM**  
Damnable both-sides rogue!

**First Soldier**  
*\[Reads]*  
'When he swears oaths, bid him drop gold, and take it;  
After he scores, he never pays the score:  
Half won is match well made; match, and well make it;  
He ne'er pays after-debts, take it before;  
And say a soldier, Dian, told thee this,  
Men are to mell with, boys are not to kiss:  
For count of this, the count's a fool, I know it,  
Who pays before, but not when he does owe it.  
Thine, as he vowed to thee in thine ear,  
PAROLLES.'

I perceive, sir, by the general's looks, we shall be  
fain to hang you.

**PAROLLES**  
My life, sir, in any case: not that I am afraid to  
die; but that, my offences being many, I would  
repent out the remainder of nature: let me live,  
sir, in a dungeon, i' the stocks, or anywhere, so I may live.

**First Soldier**  
We'll see what may be done, so you confess freely;  
therefore, once more to this Captain Dumain: you  
have answered to his reputation with the duke and to  
his valor: what is his honesty?

**PAROLLES**  
Drunkenness is his best virtue, for he will  
be swine-drunk; and in his sleep he does little  
harm, save to his bed-clothes about him; but they  
know his conditions and lay him in straw. I have but  
little more to say, sir, of his honesty: he has  
every thing that an honest man should not have; what  
an honest man should have, he has nothing.

**First Lord**  
*\[To Bertram]*  
I begin to love him for this.

**BERTRAM**  
For this description of thine honesty? A pox upon  
him for me, he's more and more a cat.

**First Soldier**  
What say you to his expertness in war?

**PAROLLES**  
Faith, sir, he has led the drum before the English  
tragedians; to belie him, I will not, and more of  
his soldiership I know not.

**First Soldier**  
What's his brother, the other Captain Dumain?

**Second Lord**  
Why does he ask him of me?

**PAROLLES**  
E'en a crow o' the same nest; not altogether so  
great as the first in goodness, but greater a great  
deal in evil: he excels his brother for a coward.

**First Soldier**  
If your life be saved, will you undertake to betray  
the Florentine?

**PAROLLES**  
Ay, and the captain of his horse, Count Rousillon.

**First Soldier**  
I'll whisper with the general, and know his pleasure.

**PAROLLES**  
*\[Aside]*  
I'll no more drumming; a plague of all  
drums! Only to seem to deserve well, and to  
beguile the supposition of that lascivious young boy  
the count, have I run into this danger. Yet who  
would have suspected an ambush where I was taken?

**First Soldier**  
There is no remedy, sir, but you must die: the  
general says, you that have so traitorously  
discovered the secrets of your army and made such  
pestiferous reports of men very nobly held, can  
serve the world for no honest use; therefore you  
must die. Come, headsman, off with his head.

**PAROLLES**  
O Lord, sir, let me live, or let me see my death!

**First Lord**  
That shall you, and take your leave of all your friends.

*\[Unblinding him]*  
So, look about you: know you any here?

**BERTRAM**  
Good morrow, noble captain.

**Second Lord**  
Captain, what greeting will you to my Lord Lafeu?  
I am for France.

**First Lord**  
Good captain, will you give me a copy of the sonnet  
you writ to Diana in behalf of the Count Rousillon?  
an I were not a very coward, I'd compel it of you:  
but fare you well.

*Exeunt BERTRAM and Lords*

**First Soldier**  
You are undone, captain, all but your scarf; that  
has a knot on't yet

*Exit*

**PAROLLES**  
Yet am I thankful: if my heart were great,  
'Twould burst at this. Captain I'll be no more;  
But I will eat and drink, and sleep as soft  
As captain shall: simply the thing I am  
Shall make me live. Who knows himself a braggart,  
Let him fear this, for it will come to pass  
that every braggart shall be found an ass.  
Rust, sword? cool, blushes! and, Parolles, live  
Safest in shame! being fool'd, by foolery thrive!  
There's place and means for every man alive.  
I'll after them.

*Exit*

### SCENE IV. Florence. The Widow's house.

*Enter HELENA, Widow, and DIANA*

**HELENA**  
That you may well perceive I have not wrong'd you,  
One of the greatest in the Christian world  
Shall be my surety; I am inform'd  
His grace is at Marseilles; to which place  
We have convenient convoy. You must know  
I am supposed dead: the army breaking,  
My husband hies him home; where, heaven aiding,  
And by the leave of my good lord the king,  
We'll be before our welcome. ...

**Widow**  
... Gentle madam,  
You never had a servant to whose trust  
Your business was more welcome. ...

**HELENA**  
... Nor you, mistress,  
Ever a friend whose thoughts more truly labor  
To recompense your love: doubt not but heaven  
Hath brought me up to be your daughter's dower,  
As it hath fated her to be my motive  
And helper to a husband. You, Diana,  
Under my poor instructions yet must suffer  
Something in my behalf. ...

**DIANA**  
... Let death and honesty  
Go with your impositions, I am yours  
Upon your will to suffer. ...

**HELENA**  
... Yet, I pray you:  
But with the word the time will bring on summer,  
When briers shall have leaves as well as thorns,  
And be as sweet as sharp. We must away;  
Our wagon is prepared, and time revives us:  
All's well that ends well; still the fine's the crown;  
Whate'er the course, the end is the renown.

*Exeunt*

### SCENE V. Rousillon. The COUNT's palace.

*Enter COUNTESS, LAFEU, and Clown*

**LAFEU**  
No, no, no, your son was misled with a snipt-taffeta  
fellow there, whose villainous saffron would have  
made all the unbaked and doughy youth of a nation in  
his color: your daughter-in-law had been alive at  
this hour, and your son here at home, more advanced  
by the king than by that red-tailed humble-bee I speak of.

**COUNTESS**  
I would I had not known him; it was the death of the  
most virtuous gentlewoman that ever nature had  
praise for creating. If she had partaken of my  
flesh, and cost me the dearest groans of a mother, I  
could not have owed her a more rooted love.

**LAFEU**  
'Twas a good lady, 'twas a good lady: we may pick a  
thousand salads ere we light on such another herb.

**Clown**  
Indeed, sir, she was the sweet marjoram of the  
salad, or rather, the herb of grace.

**LAFEU**  
They are not herbs, you knave; they are nose-herbs.

**Clown**  
I am no great Nebuchadnezzar, sir; I have not much  
skill in grass.

**LAFEU**  
Whether dost thou profess thyself, a knave or a fool?

**Clown**  
A fool, sir, at a woman's service, and a knave at a man's.

**LAFEU**  
Go thy ways, I begin to be aweary of thee; and I  
tell thee so before, because I would not fall out  
with thee. Go thy ways: let my horses be well  
looked to, without any tricks.

*Clown Exits*

And I was about to tell you, since I heard of the  
good lady's death and that my lord your son  
was upon his return home, I moved the king  
my master to speak in the behalf of my  
daughter; which, in the minority of them both,  
his majesty, out of a self-gracious remembrance, did  
first propose: his highness hath promised me to do  
it: and, to stop up the displeasure he hath  
conceived against your son, there is no fitter  
matter. How does your ladyship like it?

**COUNTESS**  
With very much content, my lord; and I wish it  
happily effected.

**LAFEU**  
His highness comes post from Marseilles, of as able  
body as when he numbered thirty: he will be here  
tomorrow, or I am deceived by him that in such  
intelligence hath seldom failed.

**COUNTESS**  
It rejoices me, that I hope I shall see him ere I  
die. I have letters that my son will be here  
tonight: I shall beseech your lordship to remain  
with me till they meet together.

**LAFEU**  
Madam, I was thinking with what manners I might  
safely be admitted.

**COUNTESS**  
You need but plead your honorable privilege.

**LAFEU**  
Lady, of that I have made a bold charter; but I  
thank my God it holds yet.

*Re-enter Clown*

**Clown**  
O madam, yonder's my lord your son with a patch of  
velvet on's face: whether there be a scar under't  
or no, the velvet knows; but 'tis a goodly patch of  
velvet.

**LAFEU**  
Let us go see your son, I pray you: I long to talk  
with the young noble soldier.

*Exeunt*

## ACT V

### SCENE I. Marseilles. A street.

*Enter HELENA, Widow, and DIANA*

**HELENA**  
But this exceeding posting day and night  
Must wear your spirits low; we cannot help it:  
But since you have made the days and nights as one,  
To wear your gentle limbs in my affairs,  
Be bold you do so grow in my requital  
As nothing can unroot you. In happy time;

*Enter a Gentleman*

This man may help me to his majesty's ear,  
If he would spend his power. God save you, sir.  
Sir, I have seen you in the court of France.

**Gentleman**  
I have been sometimes there.

What's your will? ...

**HELENA**  
... That it will please you  
To give this poor petition to the king,  
And aid me with that store of power you have  
To come into his presence. ...

**Gentleman**  
... The king's not here.
He hence removed last night and with more haste  
Than is his use. ...

**Widow**  
Lord, how we lose our pains!

**HELENA**  
ALL'S WELL THAT ENDS WELL yet,  
Though time seem so adverse and means unfit.  
I do beseech you, whither is he gone?

**Gentleman**  
Marry, as I take it, to Rousillon;  
Whither I am going.

**HELENA**  
I do beseech you, sir,  
Since you are like to see the king before me,  
Commend the paper to his gracious hand,  
Which I presume shall render you no blame  
But rather make you thank your pains for it.  
I will come after you with what good speed  
Our means will make us means.

**Gentleman**  
This I'll do for you.

**HELENA**  
And you shall find yourself to be well thank'd,  
Whate'er falls more.

*Exeunt*

### SCENE II. Rousillon. Before the COUNT's palace.
*Enter Clown, and PAROLLES, following*

**PAROLLES**  
Good Monsieur Lavache, give my Lord Lafeu this  
letter: I have ere now, sir, been better known to  
you, when I have held familiarity with fresher  
clothes; but I am now, sir, muddied in fortune's  
mood, and smell somewhat strong of her strong  
displeasure.

**Clown**  
Truly, fortune's displeasure is but sluttish, if it  
smell so strongly as thou speakest of: I will  
henceforth eat no fish of fortune's buttering.  
Prithee, allow the wind.

**PAROLLES**  
Nay, you need not to stop your nose, sir; I spake  
but by a metaphor.

**Clown**  
Indeed, sir, if your metaphor stink, I will stop my  
nose; or against any man's metaphor. Prithee, get  
thee further.

**PAROLLES**  
Pray you, sir, deliver me this paper.

**Clown**  
Foh! prithee, stand away: a paper from fortune's  
close-stool to give to a nobleman! Look, here he  
comes himself.

*Enter LAFEU*

*Exit CLOWN*

**PAROLLES**  
My lord, I am a man whom fortune hath cruelly scratched.  
I beseech your honor to hear me one single word.

**LAFEU**  
You beg a single penny more: come, you shall ha't;  
save your word.

**PAROLLES**  
My name, my good lord, is Parolles.  
It lies in you, my lord, to bring me in some grace,  
for you did bring me out.

**LAFEU**  
Out upon thee, knave! dost thou put upon me at once  
both the office of God and the devil? One brings  
thee in grace and the other brings thee out.

*Trumpets sound*

The king's coming; I know by his trumpets. Sirrah,  
inquire further after me; I had talk of you last  
night: though you are a fool and a knave, you shall  
eat; go to, follow.

**PAROLLES**  
I praise God for you.

*Exeunt*

### SCENE III. Rousillon. The COUNT's palace.

*Flourish. Enter KING, COUNTESS, LAFEU, and the Second French Lord*

**KING**  
We lost a jewel of her; and our esteem  
Was made much poorer by it: but your son,  
As mad in folly, lack'd the sense to know  
Her estimation home.

**COUNTESS**  
'Tis past, my liege;  
And I beseech your majesty to make it  
Natural rebellion, done i' the blaze of youth

**KING**  
I have forgiven and forgotten all;  
Though my revenges were high bent upon him,  
And watch'd the time to shoot.

**LAFEU**  
This I must say,  
But first I beg my pardon, the young lord  
Did to his majesty, his mother and his lady  
Offence of mighty note; but to himself  
The greatest wrong of all. He lost a wife  
Whose beauty did astonish the survey  
Of richest eyes, whose words all ears took captive,  
Whose dear perfection hearts that scorn'd to serve  
Humbly call'd mistress.

**KING**  
Praising what is lost  
Makes the remembrance dear. Well, call him hither;  
A stranger, no offender; and inform him  
So 'tis our will he should. ...

**Second Lord**  
I shall, my liege.

*Exit*

**KING**  
What says he to your daughter? have you spoke?

**LAFEU**  
All that he is hath reference to your highness.

**KING**  
Then shall we have a match. I have letters sent me  
That set him high in fame.

*Enter BERTRAM*

**LAFEU**  
He looks well on't. ...

**KING**  
... I am not a day of season,  
For thou mayst see a sunshine and a hail  
In me at once: but to the brightest beams  
Distracted clouds give way; so stand thou forth;  
The time is fair again. ...

**BERTRAM**  
... My high-repented blames,  
Dear sovereign, pardon to me. ...

**KING**  
... All is whole;  
Not one word more of the consumed time.  
Let's take the instant by the forward top;  
You remember the daughter of this lord?

**BERTRAM**  
Admiringly, my liege, at first  
I stuck my choice upon her, ere my heart  
Durst make too bold a herald of my tongue  
That she whom all men praised and whom myself,  
Since I have lost, have loved, was in mine eye  
The dust that did offend it. ...

**KING**  
... Well excused:  
That thou didst love her, strikes some scores away  
From the great compt: but love that comes too late,  
To the great sender turns a sour offence,  
Crying, 'That's good that's gone.' Our rash faults  
Make trivial price of serious things we have,  
Not knowing them until we know their grave:  
Be this sweet Helen's knell, and now forget her.  
The main consents are had; and here we'll stay  
To see our widower's second marriage-day.

**LAFEU**  
Come on, my son, in whom my house's name  
Must be digested, give a favor from you  
To sparkle in the spirits of my daughter,  
That she may quickly come. ...

*BERTRAM gives a ring*

... By my old beard,  
And every hair that's on't, Helen, that's dead,  
Was a sweet creature: such a ring as this,  
The last that e'er I took her at court,  
I saw upon her finger. ...

**BERTRAM**  
... Hers it was not.

**KING**  
Now, pray you, let me see it; for mine eye,  
While I was speaking, oft was fasten'd to't.  
This ring was mine; and, when I gave it Helen,  
I bade her, if her fortunes ever stood  
Necessitied to help, that by this token  
I would relieve her. Had you that craft, to reave her  
Of what should stead her most? ...

**BERTRAM**  
... My gracious sovereign,  
Howe'er it pleases you to take it so,  
The ring was never hers. ...

**COUNTESS**  
... Son, on my life,  
I have seen her wear it; and she reckon'd it  
At her life's rate. ...

**LAFEU**  
... I am sure I saw her wear it.

**BERTRAM**  
You are deceived, my lord; she never saw it:  
In Florence was it from a casement thrown me,  
Wrapp'd in a paper, which contain'd the name  
Of her that threw it: noble she was, and thought  
I stood engaged: but when I had subscribed  
To mine own fortune and inform'd her fully  
I could not answer in that course of honor  
As she had made the overture, she ceased  
In heavy satisfaction and would never  
Receive the ring again. ...

**KING**  
... 'Twas mine, 'twas Helen's,  
Whoever gave it you. Then, if you know  
That you are well acquainted with yourself,  
Confess 'twas hers, and by what rough enforcement  
You got it from her: she call'd the saints to surety  
That she would never put it from her finger,  
Unless she gave it to yourself in bed,  
Where you have never come, or sent it us  
Upon her great disaster. ...

**BERTRAM**  
... She never saw it.

**KING**  
Thou speak'st it falsely, as I love mine honor;  
And makest conjectural fears to come into me  
Which I would fain shut out. If it should prove  
That thou art so inhuman,--'twill not prove so;--  
And yet I know not: thou didst hate her deadly,  
And she is dead; which nothing, but to close  
Her eyes myself, could win me to believe,  
More than to see this ring. Take him away.

*Some seize BERTRAM. They Exit.*

I am wrapp'd in dismal thinkings. ...

*Enter a Gentleman*

**Gentleman**  
... Gracious sovereign,  
Whether I have been to blame or no, I know not:  
Here's a petition from a Florentine,  
Who hath for four or five removes come short  
To tender it herself. I undertook it,  
Vanquish'd thereto by the fair grace and speech  
Of the poor suppliant, who by this I know  
Is here attending: her business looks in her  
With an importing visage; and she told me,  
In a sweet verbal brief, it did concern  
Your highness with herself.

**KING**  
*\[Reads]*  
Upon his many protestations to marry me  
when his wife was dead, I blush to say it, he won  
me. Now is the Count Rousillon a widower: his vows  
are forfeited to me, and my honor's paid to him. He  
stole from Florence, taking no leave, and I follow  
him to his country for justice: grant it me, O  
king! in you it best lies; otherwise a seducer  
flourishes, and a poor maid is undone.  
DIANA CAPILET.

**LAFEU**  
I will buy me a son-in-law in a fair, and toll for  
this: I'll none of him.

**KING**  
The heavens have thought well on thee Lafeu,  
To bring forth this discovery. Seek these suitors:  
I am afeard the life of Helen, lady,  
Was foully snatch'd. ...

**COUNTESS**  
... Now, justice on the doers!

*Re-enter BERTRAM, guarded*

**KING**  
I wonder, sir, sith wives are monsters to you,  
And that you fly them as you swear them lordship,  
Yet you desire to marry. ...

*Enter Widow and DIANA*

... What woman's that?

**DIANA**  
I am, my lord, a wretched Florentine,  
Derived from the ancient Capilet:  
My suit, as I do understand, you know,  
And therefore know how far I may be pitied.

**Widow**  
I am her mother, sir, whose age and honor  
Both suffer under this complaint we bring,  
And both shall cease, without your remedy.

**KING**  
Come hither, count; do you know these women?

**BERTRAM**  
My lord, I neither can nor will deny  
But that I know them: do they charge me further?

**DIANA**  
Why do you look so strange upon your wife?

**BERTRAM**  
My lord, this is a fond and desperate creature,  
Whom sometime I have laugh'd with. ...

**DIANA**  
... Good my lord,  
Ask him upon his oath, if he does think  
He had not my virginity.

**KING**  
What say'st thou to her? ...

**BERTRAM**  
... She's impudent, my lord,  
And was a common gamester to the camp.

**DIANA**  
He does me wrong, my lord; if I were so,  
He might have bought me at a common price:  
Do not believe him. O, behold this ring,  
Whose high respect and rich validity  
Did lack a parallel; yet for all that  
He gave it to a commoner o' the camp,  
If I be one. ...

**COUNTESS**  
... He blushes, and 'tis it:  
Of six preceding ancestors, that gem,  
Conferr'd by testament to the sequent issue,  
Hath it been owed and worn. This is his wife;  
That ring's a thousand proofs. ...

**KING**  
... Methought you said  
You saw one here in court could witness it.

**DIANA**  
I did, my lord, but loath am to produce  
So bad an instrument: his name's Parolles.

**LAFEU**  
I saw the man today, if man he be.

**KING**  
Find him, and bring him hither. ...

*Exit LAFEU*

**BERTRAM**  
... What of him?  
He's quoted for a most perfidious slave,  
Whose nature sickens but to speak a truth.  
Am I or that or this for what he'll utter,  
That will speak anything? ...

**KING**  
... She hath that ring of yours.

**BERTRAM**  
I think she has: certain it is I liked her,  
And boarded her i' the wanton way of youth:  
She knew her distance and did angle for me,  
Madding my eagerness with her restraint,  
Her infinite cunning, with her modern grace,  
Subdued me to her rate: she got the ring;  
And I had that which any inferior might  
At market-price have bought. ...

**DIANA**  
... I must be patient:  
You, that have turn'd off a first so noble wife,  
May justly diet me. I pray you yet;  
Since you lack virtue, I will lose a husband;  
Send for your ring, I will return it home,  
And give me mine again. ...

**BERTRAM**  
... I have it not.

**KING**  
What ring was yours, I pray you? ...

**DIANA**  
... Sir, much like  
The same upon your finger.

**KING**  
Know you this ring? this ring was his of late.

**DIANA**  
And this was it I gave him, being abed.

**KING**  
The story then goes false, you threw it him  
Out of a casement. ...

**DIANA**  
... I have spoke the truth.

*Enter PAROLLES and LAFEU*

**BERTRAM**  
My lord, I do confess the ring was hers.

**KING**  
You boggle shrewdly, every feather stars you.  
Is this the man you speak of? ...

**DIANA**  
... Ay, my lord.

**KING**  
Tell me, sirrah, but tell me true, I charge you,  
By him and by this woman here what know you?

**PAROLLES**  
So please your majesty, my master hath been an  
honorable gentleman: tricks he hath had in him,  
which gentlemen have.

**KING**  
Come, come, to the purpose: did he love this woman?

**PAROLLES**  
He did love her, sir, as a gentleman loves a woman.

**KING**  
How is that?

**PAROLLES**  
He loved her, sir, and loved her not.

**KING**  
As thou art a knave, and no knave. What an  
equivocal companion is this!

**DIANA**  
Do you know he promised me marriage?

**PAROLLES**  
Faith, I know more than I'll speak.

**KING**  
But wilt thou not speak all thou knowest?

**PAROLLES**  
Yes, so please your majesty. I did go between them,  
as I said; but more than that, he loved her: for  
indeed he was mad for her, and talked of Satan and  
of Limbo and of Furies and I know not what: yet I  
was in that credit with them at that time that I  
knew of their going to bed, and of other motions,  
as promising her marriage, and things which would  
derive me ill will to speak of; therefore I will not  
speak what I know.

**KING**  
Thou hast spoken all already.  
This ring, you say, was yours? ...

**DIANA**  
... Ay, my good lord.

**KING**  
Where did you buy it? or who gave it you?

**DIANA**  
It was not given me, nor I did not buy it.

**KING**  
Who lent it you? ...

**DIANA**  
... It was not lent me neither.

**KING**  
Where did you find it, then? ...

**DIANA**  
... I found it not.

**KING**  
If it were yours by none of all these ways,  
How could you give it him? ...

**DIANA**  
... I never gave it him.

**LAFEU**  
This woman's an easy glove, my lord; she goes off  
and on at pleasure.

**KING**  
This ring was mine; I gave it his first wife.

**DIANA**  
It might be yours or hers, for aught I know.

**KING**  
Take her away; I do not like her now;  
To prison with her: and away with him.  
Unless thou tell'st me where thou hadst this ring,  
Thou diest within this hour. ...

**DIANA**  
... I'll never tell you.

**KING**  
Wherefore hast thou accused him all this while?

**DIANA**  
Because he's guilty, and he is not guilty:  
He knows I am no maid, and he'll swear to't;  
I'll swear I am a maid, and he knows not.  
Great king, I am no strumpet, by my life;  
I am either maid, or else this old man's wife.

**KING**  
She does abuse our ears: to prison with her.

**DIANA**  
Good mother, fetch my bail. Stay, royal sir:

*Exit Widow*

The jeweller that owes the ring is sent for,  
And he shall surety me. But for this lord,  
Who hath abused me, as he knows himself,  
Though yet he never harm'd me, here I quit him:  
He knows himself my bed he hath defiled;  
And at that time he got his wife with child:  
Dead though she be, she feels her young one kick:  
So there's my riddle: one that's dead is quick:  
And now behold the meaning. ...

*Re-enter Widow, with HELENA*

**KING**  
... Is there no exorcist  
Beguiles the truer office of mine eyes?  
Is't real that I see? ...

**HELENA**  
... No, my good lord;  
'Tis but the shadow of a wife you see,  
The name and not the thing. ...

**BERTRAM**  
... Both, both! O Pardon!

**HELENA**  
O my good lord, when I was like this maid,  
I found you wondrous kind. There is your ring;  
And, look you, here's your letter; this it says:  
'When from my finger you can get this ring  
And are by me with child,' & c. This is done:  
Will you be mine, now you are doubly won?

**BERTRAM**  
If she, my liege, can make me know this clearly,  
I'll love her dearly, ever, ever dearly.

**HELENA**  
If it appear not plain and prove untrue,  
Deadly divorce step between me and you!  
O my dear mother, do I see you living?

**LAFEU**  
Mine eyes smell onions; I shall weep anon:

**KING**  
Let us from point to point this story know,  
To make the even truth in pleasure flow.

*\[To DIANA]*  
If thou be'st yet a fresh uncropped flower,  
Choose thou thy husband, and I'll pay thy dower;  
For I can guess that by thy honest aid  
Thou keep'st a wife herself, thyself a maid.  
Of that and all the progress, more or less,  
Resolvedly more leisure shall express:  
All yet seems well; and if it end so meet,  
The bitter past, more welcome is the sweet.

*Flourish*

## EPILOGUE

**KING**  
The king's a beggar, now the play is done:  
All is well ended, if this suit be won,  
That you express content; which we will pay,  
With strife to please you, day exceeding day:  
Ours be your patience then, and yours our parts;  
Your gentle hands lend us, and take our hearts.

*Exeunt*

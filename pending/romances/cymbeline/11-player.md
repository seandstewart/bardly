# Cymbeline, 11 Players

## ACT I

### SCENE I. Britain. The garden of Cymbeline's palace.

*Enter two Gentlemen*

**First Gentleman**  
You do not meet a man but frowns: our bloods  
No more obey the heavens than our courtiers  
Still seem as does the king. /

**Second Gentleman**  
/ But what's the matter?

**First Gentleman**  
His daughter, and the heir of's kingdom, whom  
He purposed to his wife's sole son--a widow  
That late he married--hath referr'd herself  
Unto a poor but worthy gentleman: she's wedded;  
Her husband banish'd; she imprison'd: all  
Is outward sorrow; though I think the king  
Be touch'd at very heart. So is the queen,  
That most desired the match; but not a courtier,  
Although they wear their faces to the bent  
Of the king's look's, hath a heart that is not  
Glad at the thing they scowl at. /

**Second Gentleman**  
/ And why so?

**First Gentleman**  
He that hath miss'd the princess is a thing  
Too bad for bad report: he that married her--  
And therefore banish'd--is a creature such  
As, to seek through the regions of the earth  
For one his like, I do not think so fair  
an outward and such stuff within endows.

**Second Gentleman**  
You speak him far. But, pray you, tell me,  
Is she sole child to the king? /

**First Gentleman**  
/ His only child.  
He had two sons: the eldest of them at three years old,  
I' the swathing-clothes the other, from their nursery  
Were stol'n, and to this hour no guess in knowledge  
Which way they went. /

**Second Gentleman**  
/ How long is this ago?

**First Gentleman**  
Some twenty years.  
We must forbear: here comes the gentleman,  
The queen, and princess.

*Exeunt*

*Enter the QUEEN, POSTHUMUS LEONATUS, and IMOGEN*

**QUEEN**  
No, be assured you shall not find me, daughter,  
After the slander of most stepmothers,  
Ev'l-eyed unto you. For you, Posthumus,  
So soon as I can win the offended king,  
I will be known your advocate: 'twere good  
You lean'd unto his sentence with what patience  
Your wisdom may inform you. /

**POSTHUMUS LEONATUS**  
/ Please your highness,  
I will from hence to-day. /

**QUEEN**  
/ You know the peril.  
I'll fetch a turn about the garden, pitying  
The pangs of barr'd affections, though the king  
Hath charged you should not speak together.

*Exit*

**IMOGEN**  
O Diss'mbling courtesy! My dearest husband,  
I something fear my father's wrath; you must be gone.

**POSTHUMUS LEONATUS**  
My queen! my mistress!  
O lady, weep no more, lest I give cause  
To be suspected of more tenderness  
Than doth become a man. I will remain  
The loyal'st husband that did e'er plight troth:  
My residence in Rome at one Philario's,  
Who to my father was a friend, to me  
Known but by letter: thither write, my queen,  
And with mine eyes I'll drink the words you send,  
Though ink be made of gall. /

*Re-enter QUEEN*

**QUEEN**  
/ Be brief, I pray you:  
If the king come, I shall incur I know not  
How much of his displeasure. /

*\[Aside]*  
/ Yet I'll move him  
To walk this way: I never do him wrong,  
But he does buy my injuries, to be friends;  
Pays dear for my offences. /

*Exit*

**POSTHUMUS LEONATUS**  
/ Should we be taking leave  
As long a term as yet we have to live,  
The loathness to depart would grow. Adieu!

**IMOGEN**  
This diamond was my mother's: take it, heart;  
But keep it till you woo another wife,  
When Imogen is dead. /

**POSTHUMUS LEONATUS**  
*\[Putting on the ring]*  
/ Remain, remain thou here  
While sense can keep it on. And, sweetest, fairest,  
As I my poor self did exchange for you,  
To your so infinite loss, for my sake wear this;  
It is a manacle of love; I'll place it  
Upon this fairest pris'ner. /  
*\[Putting a bracelet upon her arm]*

**IMOGEN**  
/ O the gods!  
When shall we see again?

*Enter CYMBELINE and Lords*

**POSTHUMUS LEONATUS**  
Alack, the king! The gods protect you!  
And bless the good remainders of the court! I am gone.

*Exit*

**CYMBELINE**  
O disloyal thing, That shouldst repair my youth, thou heap'st  
A year's age on me. /

**IMOGEN**  
/ I beseech you, sir,  
Harm not yourself with your vexation  
I am senseless of your wrath; a touch more rare  
Subdues all pangs, all fears.

**CYMBELINE**  
That mightst have had the sole son of my queen!

**IMOGEN**  
O blest, that I might not! I chose an eagle,  
And did avoid a puttock.

**CYMBELINE**  
Thou took'st a beggar; wouldst have made my throne  
A seat for baseness. /

**IMOGEN**  
/ No; I rather added  
A lustre to it. /

**CYMBELINE**  
/ O thou vile one! /

**IMOGEN**  
/ Sir,  
It is your fault that I have loved Posthumus:  
You bred him as my playfellow, and he is  
A man worth any woman, overbuys me  
Almost the sum he pays. /

**CYMBELINE**  
/ What, art thou mad?

**IMOGEN**  
Almost, sir: heaven restore me! Would I were  
A neat-herd's daughter, and my Leonatus  
Our neighbour shepherd's son! /

**CYMBELINE**  
/ Thou foolish thing!

*Re-enter QUEEN*

They were again together: you have done  
Not after our command. Away with her,  
And pen her up. /

**QUEEN**  
/ Beseech your patience. Peace,  
Dear lady daughter, peace! Sweet sovereign,  
Leave us to ourselves; and make yourself some comfort  
Out of your best advice.

*Exeunt CYMBELINE and Lords*

*Enter PISANIO*

Here is your servant. How now, sir! What news?

**PISANIO**  
My lord your son drew on my master. /

**QUEEN**  
/ Ha!  
No harm, I trust, is done? /

**PISANIO**  
/ There might have been,  
But that my master rather play'd than fought  
And had no help of anger: they were parted  
By gentlemen at hand. /

**QUEEN**  
/ I am very glad on't.

**IMOGEN**  
Why came you from your master?

**PISANIO**  
On his command: he would not suffer me  
To bring him to the haven; left these notes  
Of what commands I should be subject to,  
When 't pleased you to employ me. /

**QUEEN**  
/ This hath been  
Your faithful servant: I dare lay mine honour  
He will remain so. /

**PISANIO**  
/ I humbly thank your highness.

**QUEEN**  
Pray, walk awhile. /

**IMOGEN**  
/ About some half-hour hence,  
I pray you, speak with me: you shall at least  
Go see my lord aboard: for this time leave me.

*Exeunt*

### SCENE II. The same. A public place.

*Enter CLOTEN and two Lords*

**First Lord**  
Sir, I would advise you to shift a shirt; the  
violence of action hath made you reek as a  
sacrifice: where air comes out, air comes in:  
there's none abroad so wholesome as that you vent.

**CLOTEN**  
If my shirt were bloody, then to shift it. Have I hurt him?

**Second Lord**  
*\[Aside]*  
No, 'faith; not so much as his patience.

**CLOTEN**  
I would they had not come between us.

**Second Lord**  
*\[Aside]*  
So would I, till you had measured how long  
a fool you were upon the ground.

**CLOTEN**  
And that she should love this fellow and refuse me!

**Second Lord**  
*\[Aside]*  
If it be a sin to make a true election, she  
is damned.

**First Lord**  
Sir, as I told you always, her beauty and her brain  
go not together: she's a good sign, but I have seen  
small reflection of her wit.

**Second Lord**  
*\[Aside]*  
She shines not upon fools, lest the  
reflection should hurt her.

**CLOTEN**  
Come, I'll to my chamber. Would there had been some  
hurt done!

**Second Lord**  
*\[Aside]*  
I wish not so; unless it had been the fall  
of an ass, which is no great hurt.

*Exeunt*

### SCENE III. A room in Cymbeline's palace.

*Enter IMOGEN and PISANIO*

**IMOGEN**  
I would thou grew'st unto the shores o' the haven,  
And question'dst every sail. What was the last  
That he spake to thee? /

**PISANIO**  
/ It was his queen, his queen!

**IMOGEN**  
And that was all? /

**PISANIO**  
/ No, madam; for so long  
As he could make me with this eye or ear  
Distinguish him from others, he did keep  
Still waving, as the fits and stirs of 's mind  
Could best express how slow his soul sail'd on,  
How swift his ship.

**IMOGEN**  
I would have broke mine eye-strings; crack'd them, but  
To look upon him, till the diminution  
Of space had pointed him sharp as my needle,  
Nay, follow'd him, till he had melted from  
The smallness of a gnat to air, and then  
Have turn'd mine eye and wept. But, good Pisanio,  
When shall we hear from him? /

**PISANIO**  
/ Be assured, madam,  
With his next vantage.

**IMOGEN**  
I did not take my leave of him, but had  
Most pretty things to say: ere I could tell him  
How I would think on him at certain hours  
Such thoughts and such, or I could make him swear  
The shes of Italy should not betray  
Mine interest and his honour, or have charged him,  
At the sixth hour of morn, at noon, at midnight,  
To encounter me with orisons, for then  
I am in heaven for him; or ere I could  
Give him that parting kiss which I had set  
Betwixt two charming words, comes in my father  
And like the tyrannous breathing of the north  
Shakes all our buds from growing.

Those things I bid you do, get them dispatch'd.  
I will attend the queen. /

**PISANIO**  
/ Madam, I shall.

*Exeunt*

### SCENE IV. Rome. Philario's house.

*Enter PHILARIO, IACHIMO, and a Frenchman*

**PHILARIO**  
*Enter POSTHUMUS LEONATUS*

I beseech you all, be better known to this  
gentleman; whom I commend to you as a noble friend  
of mine.

**Frenchman**  
Sir, we have known together in Orleans.

**POSTHUMUS LEONATUS**  
By your pardon, sir, I was then a young traveller;  
rather shunned to go even with what I heard than in  
my every action to be guided by others' experiences:  
but upon my mended judgment--if I offend not to say  
it is mended--my quarrel was not altogether slight.

**IACHIMO**  
Can we, with manners, ask what was the difference?

**Frenchman**  
Safely, I think: 'twas a contention in public,  
which may, without contradiction, suffer the report.  
It was much like an argument that fell out last  
night, where each of us fell in praise of our  
country mistresses; this gentleman at that time  
vouching his to be more fair, virtuous, wise,  
chaste, constant-qualified and less attemptable  
than any the rarest of our ladies in France.

**POSTHUMUS LEONATUS**  
Being so far provoked as I was in France, I would  
abate her nothing, though I profess myself her  
adorer, not her friend.

**IACHIMO**  
As fair and as good--a kind of hand-in-hand  
comparison--had been something too fair and too good  
for any lady in Britain. If she went before others  
I have seen, as that diamond of yours outlustres  
many I have beheld. I could not but believe she  
excelled many: but I have not seen the most  
precious diamond that is, nor you the lady.

**POSTHUMUS LEONATUS**  
I praised her as I rated her: so do I my stone.

**IACHIMO**  
Either your unparagoned mistress is dead, or she's  
outprized by a trifle.

**POSTHUMUS LEONATUS**  
You are mistaken: the one may be sold, or given, if  
there were wealth enough for the purchase, or merit  
for the gift: the other is not a thing for sale,  
and only the gift of the gods.

**IACHIMO**  
Which the gods have given you?

**POSTHUMUS LEONATUS**  
Which, by their graces, I will keep.

**PHILARIO**  
Let us leave here, gentlemen.

**POSTHUMUS LEONATUS**  
Sir, with all my heart. This worthy signior, I  
thank him, makes no stranger of me; we are familiar at first.

**IACHIMO**  
With five times so much conversation, I should get  
ground of your fair mistress, make her go back, even  
to the yielding, had I admittance and opportunity to friend.

**POSTHUMUS LEONATUS**  
No, no.

**IACHIMO**  
I dare thereupon pawn the moiety of my estate to  
your ring; which, in my opinion, o'ervalues it  
something: but I make my wager rather against your  
confidence than her reputation: and, to bar your  
offence herein too, I durst attempt it against any  
lady in the world.

**PHILARIO**  
Gentlemen, enough of this.

**IACHIMO**  
Would I had put my estate and my neighbour's on the  
approbation of what I have spoke!

**POSTHUMUS LEONATUS**  
What lady would you choose to assail?

**IACHIMO**  
Yours; I will lay you ten thousand ducats to your ring,  
that, commend me to the court where your lady is,  
with no more advantage than the opportunity of a  
second conference, and I will bring from thence  
that honour of hers which you imagine so reserved.

**POSTHUMUS LEONATUS**  
I will wage against your gold, gold to it: my ring  
I hold dear as my finger; 'tis part of it.

**IACHIMO**  
You are afraid, and therein the wiser. If you buy  
ladies' flesh at a million a dram, you cannot  
preserve it from tainting: but I see you have some  
religion in you, that you fear.

**POSTHUMUS LEONATUS**  
I shall but lend my diamond till your return: my mistress  
exceeds in goodness the hugeness of your unworthy thinking:  
I dare you to this match: here's my ring.

**IACHIMO**  
By the gods, it is one. If I bring you no  
sufficient testimony that I have enjoyed the dearest  
bodily part of your mistress, my ten thousand ducats  
are yours; so is your diamond too: if I come off,  
and leave her in such honour as you have trust in,  
she your jewel, this your jewel, and my gold are  
yours: provided I have your commendation for my more  
free entertainment.

**POSTHUMUS LEONATUS**  
I embrace these conditions; let us have articles  
betwixt us. Only, thus far you shall answer: if  
you make your voyage upon her and give me directly  
to understand you have prevailed, I am no further  
your enemy; she is not worth our debate: if she  
remain unseduced, you not making it appear  
otherwise, for your ill opinion and the assault you  
have made to her chastity you shall answer me with  
your sword.

**IACHIMO**  
Your hand; a covenant: we will have these things set  
down by lawful counsel, and straight away for  
Britain, lest the bargain should catch cold and  
starve: I will fetch my gold and have our two  
wagers recorded.

**POSTHUMUS LEONATUS**  
Agreed.

*Exeunt*

### SCENE V. Britain. A room in Cymbeline's palace.

*Enter QUEEN and CORNELIUS*

**QUEEN**  
Now, lady doctor, have you brought those drugs?

**CORNELIUS**  
Pleaseth your highness, ay: here they are, madam:

*\[Presenting a small box]*  
But I beseech your grace, --wherefore you have  
Commanded of me those most poisonous compounds,  
Which are the movers of a languishing death;  
But though slow, deadly? /

**QUEEN**  
/ I wonder, doctor,  
Thou ask'st me such a question. Hast thou not learn'd me how  
To make perfumes? distil? preserve? I will try the forces  
Of these thy compounds on such creatures as  
We count not worth the hanging, but none human,  
To try the vigour of them and apply  
Allayments to their act, and by them gather  
Their several virtues and effects.

*Enter PISANIO*

*\[Aside]*  
Here comes a flattering rascal; upon him  
Will I first work: he's for his master,  
An enemy to my son. How now, Pisanio!  
Doctor, your service for this time is ended;  
Take your own way. /

*\[To PISANIO]*  
/ Hark thee, a word.

**CORNELIUS**  
*\[Aside]*  
I do not like her. I do know her spirit,  
And will not trust one of her malice with  
A drug of such damn'd nature. But there is  
No danger in what show of death it makes,  
More than the locking-up the spirits a time,  
To be more fresh, reviving. She is fool'd  
With a most false effect; and I the truer,  
So to be false with her.

*Exit*

**QUEEN**  
Weeps she still, say'st thou? Dost thou think in time  
She will not quench and let instructions enter  
Where folly now possesses? Do thou work:  
When thou shalt bring me word she loves my son,  
I'll tell thee on the instant thou art then  
As great as is thy master. Shalt thou expect,  
To be depender on a thing that leans,  
Who cannot be new built, nor has no friends,  
So much as but to prop him? /

*The QUEEN drops the box: PISANIO takes it up*

/ Thou takest up  
Thou know'st not what; but take it for thy labour:  
It is a thing I made, which hath the king  
Five times redeem'd from death: Tell thy mistress how  
The case stands with her; do't as from thyself.  
Think what a chance thou changest on, but think  
Thou hast thy mistress still, to boot, my son,  
Who shall take notice of thee: I'll move the king  
To any shape of thy preferment such  
As thou'lt desire; and then myself, I chiefly,  
That set thee on to this desert, am bound  
To load thy merit richly. Think on my words.

*\[Aside]*  
A sly and constant knave,  
Not to be shaked. I have given him that  
Which, if he take, shall quite unpeople her  
Of liegers for her sweet, and which she after,  
Except she bend her humour, shall be assured  
To taste of too.

*\[To PISANIO]*  
Fare thee well, Pisanio; Think on my words.

*Exeunt QUEEN*

**PISANIO**  
And shall do:  
But when to my good lord I prove untrue,  
I'll choke myself: there's all I'll do for you.

*Exit*

### SCENE VI. The same. Another room in the palace.

*Enter IMOGEN*

**IMOGEN**  
A father cruel, and a step-dame false;  
A foolish suitor to a wedded lady,  
That hath her husband banish'd;--O, that husband!  
My supreme crown of grief! Who may this be? Fie!

*Enter PISANIO and IACHIMO*

**PISANIO**  
Madam, a noble gentleman of Rome,  
Comes from my lord with letters. /

**IACHIMO**  
/ Change you, madam?  
The worthy Leonatus is in safety  
And greets your highness dearly. /  
*\[Presents a letter]*

**IMOGEN**  
/ Thanks, good sir:  
You're kindly welcome.

**IACHIMO**  
*\[Aside]*  
All of her that is out of door most rich!  
If she be furnish'd with a mind so rare,  
She is alone the Arabian bird, and I  
Have lost the wager. Boldness be my friend!  
Arm me, audacity, from head to foot!

**IMOGEN**  
You are as welcome, worthy sir, as I  
Have words to bid you, and shall find it so  
In all that I can do. /

*Exit PISANIO*

**IACHIMO**  
/ Thanks, fairest lady.  
What, are men mad? Hath nature given them eyes  
To see this vaulted arch, and the rich crop  
Of sea and land, which can distinguish 'twixt  
The fiery orbs above and the twinn'd stones  
Upon the number'd beach? and can we not  
Partition make with spectacles so precious  
'Twixt fair and foul?

**IMOGEN**  
What, dear sir, Thus raps you? Are you well?

**IACHIMO**  
Thanks, madam; well.

**IMOGEN**  
Continues well my lord? His health, beseech you?

**IACHIMO**  
Well, madam.

**IMOGEN**  
Is he disposed to mirth? I hope he is.

**IACHIMO**  
Exceeding pleasant; none a stranger there  
So merry and so gamesome: he is call'd  
The Briton reveller.  
There is a Frenchman his companion, one  
An eminent monsieur, that, it seems, much loves  
A Gallian girl at home; he furnaces  
The thick sighs from him, whiles the jolly Briton--  
Your lord, I mean--laughs from's free lungs, cries 'O,  
Can my sides hold, to think that man, who knows  
By history, report, or his own proof,  
What woman is, yea, what she cannot choose  
But must be, will his free hours languish for  
Assured bondage?' /

**IMOGEN**  
/ Will my lord say so?

**IACHIMO**  
Ay, madam, with his eyes in flood with laughter:  
It is a recreation to be by  
And hear him mock the Frenchman. But, heavens know,  
Some men are much to blame. /

**IMOGEN**  
/ Not he, I hope.

**IACHIMO**  
Not he: but yet heaven's bounty towards him might  
Be used more thankfully. In himself, 'tis much;  
In you, which I account his beyond all talents,  
Whilst I am bound to wonder, I am bound  
To pity too. /

**IMOGEN**  
/ What do you pity, sir?

**IACHIMO**  
Two creatures heartily. /

**IMOGEN**  
/ Am I one, sir?  
You look on me: what wreck discern you in me  
Deserves your pity? You do seem to know  
Something of me, or what concerns me: pray you,--  
Since doubling things go ill often hurts more  
Than to be sure they do; for certainties  
Either are past remedies, or, timely knowing,  
The remedy then born--discover to me  
What both you spur and stop. /

**IACHIMO**  
/ Had I this cheek  
To bathe my lips upon, should I, damn'd then,  
Slaver with lips as common as the stairs  
That mount the Capitol; join gripes with hands  
Made hard with hourly falsehood--falsehood, as  
With labour; then by-peeping in an eye  
Base and unlustrous as the smoky light  
That's fed with stinking tallow; it were fit  
That all the plagues of hell should at one time  
Encounter such revolt. /

**IMOGEN**  
/ My lord, I fear,  
Has forgot Britain. /

**IACHIMO**  
/ And himself.

**IMOGEN**  
Let me hear no more.

**IACHIMO**  
O dearest soul! your cause doth strike my heart  
With pity, that doth make me sick. A lady  
So fair, and fasten'd to an empery,  
Would make the great'st king double! Be revenged;  
Or she that bore you was no queen, and you  
Recoil from your great stock. /

**IMOGEN**  
/ Revenged!  
How should I be revenged? If this be true,  
How should I be revenged? /

**IACHIMO**  
/ Should he make me  
Live, like Diana's priest, betwixt cold sheets,  
Whiles he is vaulting variable ramps,  
In your despite, upon your purse? Revenge it.  
I dedicate myself to your sweet pleasure,  
More noble than that runagate to your bed,  
And will continue fast to your affection,  
Still close as sure. /

**IMOGEN**  
/ What, ho, Pisanio!

**IACHIMO**  
Let me my service tender on your lips.

**IMOGEN**  
Away! I do condemn mine ears that have  
So long attended thee. If thou wert honourable,  
Thou wouldst have told this tale for virtue, not  
For such an end thou seek'st,--as base as strange.  
The king my father shall be made acquainted  
Of thy assault: if he shall think it fit,  
A saucy stranger in his court to mart  
As in a Romish stew and to expound  
His beastly mind to us, he hath a court  
He little cares for and a daughter who  
He not respects at all. What, ho, Pisanio!

**IACHIMO**  
O happy Leonatus! I may say  
A lady to the worthiest sir that ever  
Country call'd his! and you his mistress, only  
For the most worthiest fit! Give me your pardon.  
I have spoke this, to know if your affiance  
Were deeply rooted; and shall make your lord,  
That which he is, new o'er: and he is one  
The truest manner'd; such a holy witch  
That he enchants societies into him;  
Half all men's hearts are his.  
He sits 'mongst men like a descended god:  
Be not angry,  
Most mighty princess, that I have adventured  
To try your taking a false report: the love I bear him  
Made me to fan you thus, but the gods made you,  
Unlike all others, chaffless. Pray, your pardon.

**IMOGEN**  
All's well, sir: take my power i' the court for yours.

**IACHIMO**  
My humble thanks. I had almost forgot  
To entreat your grace but in a small request.

**IMOGEN**  
Pray, what is't?

**IACHIMO**  
Some dozen Romans of us and your lord--  
The best feather of our wing--have mingled sums  
To buy a present for the emperor  
Which I, the factor for the rest, have done  
In France: 'tis plate of rare device, and jewels  
Of rich and exquisite form; their values great;  
And I am something curious, being strange,  
To have them in safe stowage: may it please you  
To take them in protection? /

**IMOGEN**  
/ Willingly;  
And pawn mine honour for their safety: since  
My lord hath interest in them, I will keep them  
In my bedchamber. /

**IACHIMO**  
/ They are in a trunk,  
Attended by my men: I will make bold  
To send them to you, only for this night;  
I must aboard to-morrow.

Therefore I shall beseech you, if you please  
To greet your lord with writing, do't to-night:  
I have outstood my time; which is material  
To the tender of our present. /

**IMOGEN**  
/ I will write.  
Send your trunk to me; it shall safe be kept,  
And truly yielded you. You're very welcome.

*Exeunt*

## ACT II

### SCENE I. Britain. Before Cymbeline's palace.

*Enter CLOTEN and two Lords*

**CLOTEN**  
I am not vexed more at any thing in the earth: a  
pox on't! I had rather not be so noble as I am;  
they dare not fight with me, because of the queen my  
mother: every Jack-slave hath his bellyful of  
fighting, and I must go up and down like a cock that  
nobody can match.

**Second Lord**  
*\[Aside]*  
You are cock and capon too; and you crow, cock, with your comb on.

**CLOTEN**  
Sayest thou?

**Second Lord**  
It is not fit your lordship should undertake every  
companion that you give offence to.

**CLOTEN**  
No, I know that: but it is fit I should commit  
offence to my inferiors.

**First Lord**  
There's an Italian come; and, 'tis thought, one of  
Leonatus' friends.

**CLOTEN**  
Is it fit I went to look upon him? is there no  
derogation in't?

**Second Lord**  
You cannot derogate, my lord.

**CLOTEN**  
Not easily, I think.

**Second Lord**  
*\[Aside]*  
You are a fool granted; therefore your  
issues, being foolish, do not derogate.

**CLOTEN**  
Come, I'll go see this Italian: what I have lost  
to-day at bowls I'll win to-night of him. Come, go.

**Second Lord**  
I'll attend your lordship.

*Exeunt CLOTEN and First Lord*

*Exit*

### SCENE II. Imogen's bedchamber in Cymbeline's palace: a trunk in one corner of it.

*IMOGEN in bed, sleeping. IACHIMO comes from the trunk*

**IACHIMO**  
The crickets sing, and man's o'er-labour'd sense  
Repairs itself by rest. Our Tarquin thus  
Did softly press the rushes, ere he waken'd  
The chastity he wounded. Cytherea,  
How bravely thou becomest thy bed, fresh lily,  
And whiter than the sheets! That I might touch!  
O sleep, thou ape of death, lie dull upon her!  
And be her sense but as a monument,  
Thus in a chapel lying! Come off, come off:

*\[Taking off her bracelet]*  
As slippery as the Gordian knot was hard!  
'Tis mine; and this will witness outwardly,  
To the madding of her lord. On her left breast  
A mole cinque-spotted, like the crimson drops  
I' the bottom of a cowslip: this secret  
Will force him think I have pick'd the lock and ta'en  
The treasure of her honour. No more. To what end?  
Swift, swift, you dragons of the night, that dawning  
May bare the raven's eye! I lodge in fear;  
Though this a heavenly angel, hell is here.

*Clock strikes*

*Goes into the trunk. The scene closes*

### SCENE III. An ante-chamber adjoining Imogen's apartments.

*Enter CLOTEN and Lords*

**CLOTEN**  
I would this music would come: I am advised to give  
her music o' mornings; they say it will penetrate.

*Enter Musicians*

*\[Singing]*  
Hark, hark! the lark at heaven's gate sings,  
And Phoebus 'gins arise,  
His steeds to water at those springs  
On chaliced flowers that lies;  
And winking Mary-buds begin  
To ope their golden eyes:  
With every thing that pretty is,  
My lady sweet, arise:  
Arise, arise.

*\[Spoken]*  
So, get you gone. If this penetrate, I will  
consider your music the better: if it do not, it is  
a vice in her ears, which horse-hairs and  
calves'-guts, nor the voice of unpaved eunuch to  
boot, can never amend.

*Exeunt Musicians*

If she be up, I'll speak with her; if not,  
Let her lie still and dream. /

*\[Knocks]*  
/ By your leave, ho!

*Enter IMOGEN*

Good morrow, fairest: sister, your sweet hand.

**IMOGEN**  
Good morrow, sir. You lay out too much pains  
For purchasing but trouble; the thanks I give  
Is telling you that I am poor of thanks  
And scarce can spare them. /

**CLOTEN**  
/ Still, I swear I love you.

**IMOGEN**  
If you but said so, 'twere as deep with me:  
If you swear still, your recompense is still  
That I regard it not. /

**CLOTEN**  
/ This is no answer.

**IMOGEN**  
But that you shall not say I yield being silent,  
I would not speak. I pray you, spare me: 'faith,  
I shall unfold equal discourtesy  
To your best kindness: one of your great knowing  
Should learn, being taught, forbearance.

**CLOTEN**  
To leave you in your madness, 'twere my sin:  
I will not. /

**IMOGEN**  
/ Fools are not mad folks.

**CLOTEN**  
Do you call me fool? /

**IMOGEN**  
/ As I am mad, I do:  
If you'll be patient, I'll no more be mad;  
That cures us both. I am much sorry, sir,  
You put me to forget a lady's manners,  
By being so verbal: and learn now, for all,  
That I, which know my heart, do here pronounce,  
By the very truth of it, I care not for you,  
And am so near the lack of charity--  
To accuse myself--I hate you; which I had rather  
You felt than make't my boast. /

**CLOTEN**  
/ You sin against  
Obedience, which you owe your father. For  
The contract you pretend with that base wretch,  
One bred of alms and foster'd with cold dishes,  
With scraps o' the court, it is no contract, none:  
Yet you are curb'd from that enlargement by  
The consequence o' the crown, and must not soil  
The precious note of it with a base slave.  
A hilding for a livery, a squire's cloth,  
A pantler, not so eminent. /

**IMOGEN**  
/ Profane fellow  
Wert thou the son of Jupiter and no more  
But what thou art besides, thou wert too base  
To be his groom: thou wert dignified enough,  
Even to the point of envy, to be styled  
The under-hangman of his kingdom, and hated  
For being preferred so well. /

**CLOTEN**  
/ The south-fog rot him!

**IMOGEN**  
He never can meet more mischance than come  
To be but named of thee. His meanest garment,  
That ever hath but clipp'd his body, is dearer  
In my respect than all the hairs above thee,  
Were they all made such men. How now, Pisanio!

*Enter PISANIO*

**CLOTEN**  
'His garment!' Now the devil-- /

**IMOGEN**  
/ I am sprited with a fool.  
Frighted, and anger'd worse: go bid my woman  
Search for a jewel that too casually  
Hath left mine arm: it was thy master's: I do think  
I saw't this morning: confident I am  
Last night 'twas on mine arm; I kiss'd it:  
I hope it be not gone to tell my lord  
That I kiss aught but he. /

**PISANIO**  
/ 'Twill not be lost.

**IMOGEN**  
I hope so: go and search. /

*Exit PISANIO*

**CLOTEN**  
/ You have abused me:  
'His meanest garment!' /

**IMOGEN**  
/ Ay, I said so, sir:  
If you will make't an action, call witness to't.

**CLOTEN**  
I will inform your father. /

**IMOGEN**  
/ Your mother too:  
She's my good lady, and will conceive, I hope,  
But the worst of me. So, I leave you, sir,  
To the worst of discontent.

*Exeunt*

### SCENE IV. Rome. Philario's house.

*Enter POSTHUMUS and PHILARIO*

**POSTHUMUS LEONATUS**  
Fear it not, sir: I would I were so sure  
To win the king as I am bold her honour  
Will remain hers. /

*Enter IACHIMO*

**PHILARIO**  
/ Welcome, sir.

**POSTHUMUS LEONATUS**  
I hope the briefness of your answer made  
The speediness of your return. /

**IACHIMO**  
/ Your lady  
Is one of the fairest that I have look'd upon.

**POSTHUMUS LEONATUS**  
And therewithal the best; or let her beauty  
Look through a casement to allure false hearts  
And be false with them. /

**IACHIMO**  
/ Here are letters for you.

**POSTHUMUS LEONATUS**  
Their tenor good, I trust. /

**IACHIMO**  
/ 'Tis very like.

**PHILARIO**  
Was Caius Lucius in the Britain court  
When you were there? /

**IACHIMO**  
/ He was expected then,  
But not approach'd. /

**POSTHUMUS LEONATUS**  
/ All is well yet.  
Sparkles this stone as it was wont? or is't not  
Too dull for your good wearing? /

**IACHIMO**  
/ If I had lost it,  
I should have lost the worth of it in gold.  
I'll make a journey twice as far, to enjoy  
A second night of such sweet shortness which  
Was mine in Britain, for the ring is won.

**POSTHUMUS LEONATUS**  
The stone's too hard to come by. /

**IACHIMO**  
/ Not a whit,  
Your lady being so easy. /

**POSTHUMUS LEONATUS**  
/ Make not, sir,  
Your loss your sport: I hope you know that we  
Must not continue friends. /

**IACHIMO**  
/ Good sir, we must,  
If you keep covenant. Had I not brought  
The knowledge of your mistress home, I grant  
We were to question further: but I now  
Profess myself the winner of her honour,  
Together with your ring; and not the wronger  
Of her or you, having proceeded but  
By both your wills. /

**POSTHUMUS LEONATUS**  
/ If you can make't apparent  
That you have tasted her in bed, my hand  
And ring is yours; if not, the foul opinion  
You had of her pure honour gains or loses  
Your sword or mine, or masterless leaves both  
To who shall find them. /

**IACHIMO**  
/ Sir, my circumstances,  
Being so near the truth as I will make them,  
Must first induce you to believe: whose strength  
I will confirm with oath; which, I doubt not,  
You'll give me leave to spare, when you shall find  
You need it not. /

**POSTHUMUS LEONATUS**  
/ Proceed. /

**IACHIMO**  
/ First, her bedchamber,--  
Where, I confess, I slept not, but profess  
Had that was well worth watching--it was hang'd  
With tapestry of silk and silver; the story  
Proud Cleopatra, when she met her Rom'n.

**POSTHUMUS LEONATUS**  
This is true;  
And this you might have heard of here, by me,  
Or by some other. /

**IACHIMO**  
/ The roof o' the chamber  
With golden cherubins is fretted: her andirons--  
I had forgot them--were two winking Cupids  
Of silver, each on one foot standing, nicely  
Depending on their brands. /

**POSTHUMUS LEONATUS**  
/ This is her honour!  
Let it be granted you have seen all this--and praise  
Be given to your remembrance--the description  
Of what is in her chamber nothing saves  
The wager you have laid. /

**IACHIMO**  
/ Then, if you can,

*\[Showing the bracelet]*  
Be pale: I beg but leave to air this jewel; see!

**POSTHUMUS LEONATUS**  
Jove! Once more let me behold it: is it that  
Which I left with her? /

**IACHIMO**  
/ Sir--I thank her--that:  
She stripp'd it from her arm; she gave it me, and said  
She prized it once. /

**POSTHUMUS LEONATUS**  
/ May be she pluck'd it off  
To send it me. /

**IACHIMO**  
/ She writes so to you, doth she?

**POSTHUMUS LEONATUS**  
O, no, no, no! 'tis true. Here, take this too;  
*\[Gives the ring]*

**PHILARIO**  
Have patience, sir,  
And take your ring again; 'tis not yet won:  
It may be probable she lost it; or  
Who knows if one of her women, being corrupted,  
Hath stol'n it from her? /

**POSTHUMUS LEONATUS**  
/ Very true;  
And so, I hope, he came by't. Back my ring:  
Render to me some corporal sign about her,  
More evident than this; for this was stolen.

**IACHIMO**  
By Jupiter, I had it from her arm.  
For further satisfying, under her breast--  
Worthy the pressing--lies a mole, right proud  
Of that most delicate lodging: by my life,  
I kiss'd it; and it gave me present hunger  
To feed again, though full. You do remember  
This stain upon her? /

**POSTHUMUS LEONATUS**  
/ Ay, and it doth confirm  
Another stain, as big as hell can hold,  
Were there no more but it. /

**IACHIMO**  
/ I'll be sworn--

**POSTHUMUS LEONATUS**  
No swearing.  
If you will swear you have not done't, you lie;  
And I will kill thee, if thou dost deny  
Thou'st made me cuckold. /

**IACHIMO**  
/ I'll deny nothing.

**POSTHUMUS LEONATUS**  
O, that I had her here, to tear her limb-meal!  
I will go there and do't, i' the court, before  
Her father. I'll do something-- /

*Exit*

**PHILARIO**  
/ Quite besides  
The government of patience! You have won:  
Let's follow him, and pervert the present wrath  
He hath against himself. /

**IACHIMO**  
/ With an my heart.

*Exeunt*

### SCENE V. Another room in Philario's house.

*Enter POSTHUMUS LEONATUS*

**POSTHUMUS LEONATUS**  
Is there no way for men to be but women  
Must be half-workers? We are all bastards;  
And that most venerable man which I  
Did call my father, was I know not where  
When I was stamp'd; some coiner with his tools  
Made me a counterfeit: yet my mother seem'd  
The Dian of that time so doth my wife  
The nonpareil of this. O, vengeance, vengeance!  
Me of my lawful pleasure she restrain'd  
And pray'd me oft forbearance; did it with  
A pudency so rosy the sweet view on't  
Might well have warm'd old Saturn; that I thought her  
As chaste as unsunn'd snow. O, all the devils!  
This yellow Iachimo, in an hour,--wast not?--  
Or less,--at first?--perchance he spoke not, but,  
Like a full-acorn'd boar, a German one,  
Cried 'O!' and mounted; found no opposition  
But what he look'd for should oppose and she  
Should from encounter guard. Could I find out  
The woman's part in me! For even to vice  
They are not constant but are changing still  
One vice, but of a minute old, for one  
Not half so old as that. I'll write against them,  
Detest them, curse them: yet 'tis greater skill  
In a true hate, to pray they have their will:  
The very devils cannot plague them better.

*Exit*

## ACT III

### SCENE I. Britain. A hall in Cymbeline's palace.

*Enter in state, CYMBELINE, QUEEN, and Lords at one door, and at  
another, CAIUS LUCIUS and Attendant*

**CYMBELINE**  
Now say, what would Augustus Caesar with us?

**CAIUS LUCIUS**  
When Julius Caesar, was in this Britain  
And conquer'd it, Cassibelan, thine uncle,--  
Famous in Caesar's praises, no whit less  
Than in his feats deserving it--for him  
And his succession granted Rome a tribute,  
Yearly three thousand pounds, which by thee lately  
Is left untender'd. /

**QUEEN**  
/ That opportunity  
Which then they had to take from 's, to resume  
We have again. Remember, sir, my liege,  
The kings your ancestors, together with  
The natural bravery of your isle, which stands  
As Neptune's park, ribbed and paled in  
With rocks unscalable and roaring waters,  
With sands that will not bear your enemies' boats,  
But suck them up to the topmast. A kind of conquest  
Caesar made here; but made not here his brag  
Of 'Came' and 'saw' and 'overcame: ' with shame--  
That first that ever touch'd him--he was carried  
From off our coast, twice beaten; and his shipping--  
Poor ignorant baubles!-- upon our terrible seas,  
Like egg-shells moved upon their surges, crack'd  
As easily 'gainst our rocks: for joy whereof  
The famed Cassibelan, who was once at point--  
O giglot fortune!--to master Caesar's sword,  
Made Lud's town with rejoicing fires bright  
And Britons strut with courage. /

**CYMBELINE**  
/ You must know,  
Till the injurious Romans did extort  
This tribute from us, we were free:  
Caesar's ambition, against all colour here  
Did put the yoke upon 's; which to shake off  
Becomes a warlike people, whom we reckon  
Ourselves to be. /

**CAIUS LUCIUS**  
/ I am sorry, Cymbeline,  
That I am to pronounce Caesar--thine enemy:  
Receive it from me, then: war and confusion  
In Caesar's name pronounce I 'gainst thee.

**CYMBELINE**  
Thy Caesar knighted me; my youth I spent  
Much under him; of him I gather'd honour;  
Which he to seek of me again, perforce,  
Behoves me keep at utterance. I am perfect  
That the Pannonians and Dalmatians for  
Their liberties are now in arms; a precedent  
Which not to read would show the Britons cold:  
So Caesar shall not find them. /

**CAIUS LUCIUS**  
/ Let proof speak.

**CYMBELINE**  
I know your master's pleasure and he mine:  
All the remain is 'Welcome!'

*Exeunt*

### SCENE II. Another room in the palace.

*Enter PISANIO, with a letter*

**PISANIO**  
How? of adultery? Wherefore write you not  
What monster's her accuser? Leonatus,  
O master! what a strange infection  
Is fall'n into thy ear! Disloyal! No:  
She's punish'd for her truth, and undergoes,  
More goddess-like than wife-like, such assaults  
As would take in some virtue. O my master!  
Thy mind to her is now as low as were  
Thy fortunes. How! that I should murder her?  
Upon the love and truth and vows which I  
Have made to thy command? I, her? her blood?  
If it be so to do good service, never  
Let me be counted serviceable. How look I,  
That I should seem to lack humanity  
So much as this fact comes to? /

*\[Reading]*  
/ 'Do't: the letter  
that I have sent her, by her own command  
Shall give thee opportunity.' O damn'd paper!  
Black as the ink that's on thee! Senseless bauble,  
Art thou a feodary for this act, and look'st  
So virgin-like without? Lo, here she comes.  
I am ignorant in what I am commanded.

*Enter IMOGEN*

**IMOGEN**  
How now, Pisanio!

**PISANIO**  
Madam, here is a letter from my lord.

**IMOGEN**  
Who? thy lord? that is my lord, Leonatus!

*\[Reads]*  
'Justice, and your father's wrath, should he take me  
in his dominion, could not be so cruel to me, as  
you, O the dearest of creatures, would even renew me  
with your eyes. Take notice that I am in Cambria,  
at Milford-Haven: what your own love will out of  
this advise you, follow. So he wishes you all  
happiness, that remains loyal to his vow, and your,  
increasing in love,  
LEONATUS POSTHUMUS.'

*\[To PISANIO]*  
O, for a horse with wings! Hear'st thou, Pisanio?  
Tell me how Wales was made so happy as  
To inherit such a haven: but first of all,  
How we may steal from hence, and for the gap  
That we shall make in time, from our hence-going  
And our return, to excuse: but first, how get hence:  
Why should excuse be born or e'er begot?  
We'll talk of that hereafter. Prithee, speak,  
How many score of miles may we well ride  
'Twixt hour and hour? /

**PISANIO**  
One score 'twixt sun and sun,  
Madam, 's enough for you: /

*\[Aside]*  
/ and too much too.

**IMOGEN**  
Go bid my woman feign a sickness; say  
She'll home to her father: and provide me presently  
A riding-suit, no costlier than would fit  
A franklin's housewife. /

**PISANIO**  
/ Madam, you're best consider.

**IMOGEN**  
Do as I bid thee: there's no more to say, Accessible is none but Milford way.

*Exeunt*

### SCENE III. Wales: a mountainous country with a cave.

*Enter, from the cave, BELARIUS; GUIDERIUS, and ARVIRAGUS following*

**BELARIUS**  
A goodly day not to keep house, with such  
Whose roof's as low as ours! Hail, thou fair heaven!  
We house i' the rock, yet use thee not so hardly  
As prouder livers do. /

**GUIDERIUS**  
/ Hail, heaven! /

**ARVIRAGUS**  
/ Hail, heaven!

**BELARIUS**  
Now for our mountain sport: up to yond hill;  
Your legs are young; I'll tread these flats. Consider,  
When you above perceive me like a crow,  
That it is place which lessens and sets off;  
And you may then revolve what tales I have told you  
Of courts, of princes, of the tricks in war.

*Exeunt GUIDERIUS and ARVIRAGUS*

How hard it is to hide the sparks of nature!  
These boys know little they are sons to the king;  
Nor Cymbeline dreams that they are alive.  
This Polydore, The heir of Cymbeline, who  
His father call'd Guiderius, and younger  
Cadwal, once Arviragus, in as like a figure,  
Strikes life into my speech and shows much more  
His own conceiving. O Cymbeline! heav'n  
and my conscience knows Thou didst unjustly  
Banish me: whereon, I stole these babes;  
Thinking to bar thee of succession, as  
Thou reft'st me of my lands. Euriphile,  
Thou wast their nurse; they took thee for their mother,  
And every day do honour to her grave:  
Myself, Belarius, that am Morgan call'd,  
They take for natural father. The game is up.

*Exit*

### SCENE IV. Country near Milford-Haven.

*Enter PISANIO and IMOGEN*

**IMOGEN**  
Thou told'st me, when we came from horse, the place  
Was near at hand: ne'er long'd my mother so  
To see me first, as I have now. Pisanio! Man!  
Where is Posthumus? What is in thy mind,  
That makes thee stare thus? What's the matter?  
Why tender'st thou that paper to me, with  
A look untender? If't be summer news,  
Smile to't before; if winterly, thou need'st  
But keep that countenance still. My husband's hand!  
That drug-damn'd Italy hath out-craftied him,  
And he's at some hard point. Speak, man: thy tongue  
May take off some extremity, which to read  
Would be even mortal to me. /

**PISANIO**  
/ Please you, read.

**IMOGEN**  
*\[Reads]*  
'Thy mistress, Pisanio, hath played the  
strumpet in my bed; the testimonies whereof lie  
bleeding in me. I speak not out of weak surmises,  
but from proof as strong as my grief and as certain  
as I expect my revenge. That part thou, Pisanio,  
must act for me, if thy faith be not tainted with  
the breach of hers. Let thine own hands take away  
her life: I shall give thee opportunity at  
Milford-Haven.'

*\[To PISANIO]*  
False to his bed! What is it to be false?  
To lie in watch there and to think on him?  
To weep 'twixt clock and clock? if sleep charge nature,  
To break it with a fearful dream of him  
And cry myself awake? that's false to's bed, is it?  
I false! Thy conscience witness: Iachimo,  
Thou didst accuse him of incontinency;  
Thou then look'dst like a villain; now methinks  
Thy favour's good enough. Some jay of Italy  
Whose mother was her painting, hath betray'd him:  
Poor I am stale, a garment out of fashion;  
And, for I am richer than to hang by the walls,  
I must be ripp'd:--to pieces with me!--O,  
Men's vows are women's traitors! All good seeming,  
By thy revolt, O husband, shall be thought  
Put on for villany; not born where't grows,  
But worn a bait for ladies. /

**PISANIO**  
/ Good madam, hear me.

**IMOGEN**  
True honest men being heard, like false Aeneas,  
Were in his time thought false, and Sinon's weeping  
Did scandal many a holy tear, took pity  
From most true wretchedness: so thou, Posthumus,  
Wilt lay the leaven on all proper men;  
Goodly and gallant shall be false and perjured  
From thy great fall. Come, fellow, be thou honest:  
Do thou thy master's bidding: when thou see'st him,  
A little witness my obedience: look!  
I draw the sword myself: take it, and hit  
The innocent mansion of my love, my heart;  
Fear not; 'tis empty of all things but grief;  
Thy master is not there, who was indeed  
The riches of it: do his bidding; strike  
Thou mayst be valiant in a better cause;  
But now thou seem'st a coward. /

**PISANIO**  
/ Hence, vile instrument!  
Thou shalt not damn my hand. /

**IMOGEN**  
/ Why, I must die;  
And if I do not by thy hand, thou art  
No servant of thy master's. Against self-slaughter  
There is a prohibition so divine  
That cravens my weak hand. Come, here's my heart.  
Something's afore't. Soft, soft! we'll no defence;  
Obedient as the scabbard. What is here?  
The scriptures of the loyal Leonatus,  
All turn'd to heresy? Away, away,  
Corrupters of my faith! you shall no more  
Be stomachers to my heart. Thus may poor fools  
Believe false teachers: though those that are betray'd  
Do feel the treason sharply, yet the traitor  
Stands in worse case of woe.  
And thou, Posthumus, thou that didst set up  
My disobedience 'gainst the king my father  
And make me put into contempt the suits  
Of princely fellows, shalt hereafter find  
It is no act of common passage, but  
A strain of rareness: and I grieve myself  
To think, when thou shalt be disedged by her  
That now thou tirest on, how thy memory  
Will then be pang'd by me. Prithee, dispatch:  
The lamb entreats the butcher: where's thy knife?

**PISANIO**  
O gracious lady,  
Since I received command to do this business  
I have not slept one wink. /

**IMOGEN**  
/ Wherefore then  
Didst undertake it? Why hast thou abused  
So many miles with a pretence? this place?  
Mine action and thine own? /

**PISANIO**  
/ But to win time  
To lose so bad employment; in the which  
I have consider'd of a course. Good lady,  
Hear me with patience.

**IMOGEN**  
Talk thy tongue weary; speak. /

**PISANIO**  
/ Then, madam,  
I thought you would not back again. /

**IMOGEN**  
/ Most like;  
Bringing me here to kill me. /

**PISANIO**  
/ Not so, neither:  
Some villain, ay, and singular in his art.  
Hath done you both this cursed injury.  
I'll give but notice you are dead and send him  
Some bloody sign of it; for 'tis commanded  
I should do so: you shall be miss'd at court,  
And that will well confirm it. /

**IMOGEN**  
/ Why good fellow,  
What shall I do the where? where bide? how live?  
No court, no father; nor no more ado  
With that harsh, noble, simple nothing,  
That Cloten, whose love-suit hath been to me  
As fearful as a siege. /

**PISANIO**  
/ The ambassador,  
Lucius the Roman, comes to Milford-Haven  
To-morrow: now, if you could wear a mind  
Dark as your fortune is, and but disguise  
That which, to appear itself, must not yet be  
But by self-danger, you should tread a course  
Pretty and full of view; yea, haply, near  
The residence of Posthumus; so nigh at least  
That though his actions were not visible, yet  
Report should render him hourly to your ear  
As truly as he moves.  
You must forget to be a woman; change  
Command into obedience: fear and niceness--  
The handmaids of all women, or, more truly,  
Woman its pretty self--into a waggish courage:  
Forget that rarest treasure of your cheek,  
Exposing it--but, O, the harder heart!

**IMOGEN**  
Nay, be brief  
I see into thy end, and am almost  
A man already. /

**PISANIO**  
/ First, make yourself but like one.  
Fore-thinking this, I have already fit--  
'Tis in my cloak-bag--doublet, hat, hose, all  
That answer to them. 'fore noble Lucius  
Present yourself, desire his service, tell him  
wherein you're happy,--which you'll make him know,  
If that his head have ear in music,--doubtless  
With joy he will embrace you, for he's honourable  
And doubling that, most holy.  
Well, madam, we must take a short farewell,  
Lest, being miss'd, I be suspected of  
Your carriage from the court. My noble mistress,  
Here is a box; I had it from the queen:  
What's in't is precious; if you are sick at sea,  
Or stomach-qualm'd at land, a dram of this  
Will drive away distemper. To some shade,  
And fit you to your manhood. May the gods  
Direct you to the best! /

**IMOGEN**  
/ Amen: I thank thee.

*Exeunt, severally*

## INTERMISSION

### SCENE V. A room in Cymbeline's palace.

*Enter CYMBELINE, QUEEN, CLOTEN, LUCIUS, Lords, and Attendants*

**CAIUS LUCIUS**  
Your hand, my lord.

**CLOTEN**  
Receive it friendly; but from this time forth  
I wear it as your enemy. /

**CAIUS LUCIUS**  
/ Sir, the event  
Is yet to name the winner: fare you well.

**CYMBELINE**  
Leave not the worthy Lucius, good my lords,  
Till he have cross'd the Severn. Happiness!

*Exeunt LUCIUS and Lords*

But, my gentle queen, where is our daughter?  
She hath not appear'd before the Roman,  
nor to us tender'd The duty of the day:  
she looks us like a thing more made of malice  
than of duty. Call her before us; for  
We have been too slight in sufferance. /

*Exit an Attendant*

**QUEEN**  
/ Royal sir,  
Since the exile of Posthumus, most retired  
Hath her life been; the cure whereof, my lord,  
'Tis time must do. Beseech your majesty,  
Forbear sharp speeches to her: she's a lady  
So tender of rebukes that words are strokes  
And strokes death to her. /

*Re-enter Attendant*

**Attendant**  
/ Please you, sir,  
Her chambers are all lock'd; and there's no answer  
That will be given to the loudest noise we make.

**QUEEN**  
My lord, when last I went to visit her,  
She pray'd me to excuse her keeping close,  
Whereto constrain'd by her infirmity,  
She should that duty leave unpaid to you,  
Which daily she was bound to proffer: this  
She wish'd me to make known; but our great court  
Made me to blame in memory. /

**CYMBELINE**  
/ Her doors lock'd?  
Not seen of late? Grant, heavens, that which I fear  
Prove false! /

*Exit*

**QUEEN**  
/ Son, I say, follow the king.

*Exit CLOTEN*

Pisanio, thou that stand'st so for Posthumus!  
He hath a drug of mine; I pray his absence  
Proceed by swallowing that. But for her,  
Where is she gone? Haply, despair hath seized her,  
Or, wing'd with fervor of her love, she's flown  
To her desired Posthumus: gone she is  
To death or to dishonour; and my end  
Can make good use of either: she being down,  
I have the placing of the British crown.

*Re-enter CLOTEN*

How now, my son! /

**CLOTEN**  
/ 'Tis certain she is fled.  
Go in and cheer the king: he rages; none  
Dare come about him. /

**QUEEN**  
*\[Aside]*  
/ All the better: may  
This night forestall him of the coming day!

*Exeunt all but Cloten*

*Enter PISANIO*

**CLOTEN**  
Where is thy lady? In a word; or else  
Thou art straightway with the fiends.

**PISANIO**  
O, good my lord!

**CLOTEN**  
I'll have this secret from thy heart, or rip  
Thy heart to find it. Is she with Posthumus?

**PISANIO**  
How can she be with him? When was she missed?  
He is in Rome.

**CLOTEN**  
Discover where thy mistress is at once,  
At the next word: no more of 'worthy lord!'  
Speak, or thy silence on the instant is  
Thy condemnation and thy death. /

**PISANIO**  
/ Then, sir,  
This paper is the history of my knowledge  
Touching her flight. /  
*\[Presenting a letter]*

**CLOTEN**  
/ Let's see't. I will pursue her  
Even to Augustus' throne. /

**PISANIO**  
*\[Aside]*  
/ Or this, or perish.

**CLOTEN**  
Sirrah, is this letter true? /

**PISANIO**  
/ Sir, as I think.

**CLOTEN**  
It is Posthumus' hand; I know't. Sirrah, if thou  
wouldst not be a villain, but do me true service,  
directly and truly, I would think thee an honest  
man: thou shouldst neither want my means for thy  
relief nor my voice for thy preferment.  
Wilt thou serve me?

**PISANIO**  
Sir, I will.

**CLOTEN**  
Give me thy hand; here's my purse. Hast any of thy  
late master's garments in thy possession?

**PISANIO**  
I have, my lord, at my lodging, the same suit he  
wore when he took leave of my lady and mistress.

**CLOTEN**  
The first service thou dost me, fetch that suit  
hither: let it be thy lint service; go. /

**PISANIO**  
/ I shall, my lord.

*Exit*

**CLOTEN**  
Meet thee at Milford-Haven!--I forgot to ask him one  
thing; I'll remember't anon:--even there, thou  
villain Posthumus, will I kill thee. I would these  
garments were come. She said upon a time--the  
bitterness of it I now belch from my heart--that she  
held the very garment of Posthumus in more respect  
than my noble and natural person together with the  
adornment of my qualities. With that suit upon my  
back, will I ravish her: first kill him, and in her  
eyes; there shall she see my valour, which will then  
be a torment to her contempt. He on the ground, my  
speech of insultment ended on his dead body, and  
when my lust hath dined,--which, as I say, to vex  
her I will execute in the clothes that she so  
praised,--to the court I'll knock her back, foot  
her home again. She hath despised me rejoicingly,  
and I'll be merry in my revenge.

*Re-enter PISANIO, with the clothes*

Be those the garments? /

**PISANIO**  
/ Ay, my noble lord.

**CLOTEN**  
Bring this apparel to my chamber; that is the second  
thing that I have commanded thee: the third is,  
that thou wilt be a voluntary mute to my design. Be  
but duteous, and true preferment shall tender itself  
to thee. My revenge is now at Milford: would I had  
wings to follow it! Come, and be true.

*Exit*

**PISANIO**  
Thou bid'st me to my loss: for true to thee  
Were to prove false, which I will never be,  
To him that is most true. To Milford go,  
And find not her whom thou pursuest. Flow, flow,  
You heavenly blessings, on her! This fool's speed  
Be cross'd with slowness; labour be his meed!

*Exit*

### SCENE VI. Wales. Before the cave of Belarius.

*Enter IMOGEN, in boy 's clothes*

**IMOGEN**  
I see a man's life is a tedious one:  
I have tired myself, and for two nights together  
Have made the ground my bed. I should be sick,  
But that my resolution helps me. Milford,  
When from the mountain-top Pisanio show'd thee,  
Thou wast within a ken: O Jove! I think  
Foundations fly the wretched; such, I mean,  
Where they should be relieved. Two beggars told me  
I could not miss my way: will poor folks lie,  
That have afflictions on them, knowing 'tis  
A punishment or trial? Yes; no wonder,  
When rich ones scarce tell true. To lapse in fulness  
Is sorer than to lie for need, and falsehood  
Is worse in kings than beggars. My dear lord!  
Thou art one o' the false ones. Now I think on thee,  
My hunger's gone; but even before, I was  
At point to sink for food. But what is this?  
Here is a path to't: 'tis some savage hold:  
I were best not t'call; I dare not call: yet fam'ne,  
Ere clean it o'erthrow nature, makes it valiant,  
Plenty and peace breeds cowards: hardness ever  
Of hardiness is mother. Ho! who's here?  
If any thing that's civil, speak; if savage,  
Take or lend. Ho! No answer? Then I'll enter.  
Best draw my sword: and if mine enemy  
But fear the sword like me, he'll scarcely look on't.  
Such a foe, good heavens!

*Exit, to the cave*

*Enter BELARIUS, GUIDERIUS, and ARVIRAGUS*

**BELARIUS**  
You, Polydote, have proved best woodman and  
Are master of the feast: Cadwal and I  
Will play the cook and servant; 'tis our match:  
The sweat of industry would dry and die,  
But for the end it works to. Come; our stomachs  
Will make what's homely savoury: weariness  
Can snore upon the flint, when resty sloth  
Finds the down pillow hard. Now peace be here,  
Poor house, that keep'st thyself!

**GUIDERIUS**  
There is cold meat i' the cave; we'll browse on that,  
Whilst what we have kill'd be cook'd.

*Re-enter IMOGEN*

**IMOGEN**  
Good masters, harm me not:  
Before I enter'd here, I call'd; and thought  
To've begg'd or bought what I have took: good troth,  
I have stol'n nought, nor would not, though I'd found  
Gold strew'd i' the floor. Here's money for my meat.

**GUIDERIUS**  
Money, youth?

**ARVIRAGUS**  
All gold and silver rather turn to dirt!  
As 'tis no better reckon'd, but of those  
Who worship dirty gods. /

**BELARIUS**  
/ Whither bound?

**IMOGEN**  
To Milford-Haven. /

**BELARIUS**  
/ What's your name?

**IMOGEN**  
Fidele, sir. /

**BELARIUS**  
/ Prithee, fair youth,  
'Tis almost night: you shall have better cheer  
Ere you depart: and thanks to stay and eat it.  
Boys, bid him welcome. /

**GUIDERIUS**  
/ Were you a woman, youth,  
I should woo hard but be your groom. In honesty,  
I bid for you as I'd buy. /

**ARVIRAGUS**  
/ I'll make't my comfort  
He is a man; I'll love him as my brother:  
And such a welcome as I'd give to him  
After long absence, such is yours: most welcome!  
Be sprightly, for you fall 'mongst friends. /

**IMOGEN**  
/ 'Mongst friends,  
If brothers. /

*\[Aside]*  
/ Would it had been so, that they  
Had been my father's sons! then had my prize  
Been less, and so more equal ballasting  
To thee, Posthumus. /

**BELARIUS**  
He wrings at some distress.

**GUIDERIUS**  
Would I could free't! /

**ARVIRAGUS**  
/ Or I, whate'er it be,  
What pain it cost, what danger. God's!

**BELARIUS**  
Hark, boys. /  
*\[Whispering]*

**IMOGEN**  
*\[Aside]*  
/ Great men,  
That had a court no bigger than this cave,  
That did attend themselves and had the virtue  
Which their own conscience seal'd them--laying by  
That nothing-gift of differing multitudes--  
Could not out-peer these twain. Pardon me, gods!  
I'd change my sex to be companion with them,  
Since Leonatus's false. /

**BELARIUS**  
/ It shall be so.  
Boys, we'll go dress our hunt. Fair youth, come in:  
Discourse is heavy, fasting; when we have supp'd,  
We'll mannerly demand thee of thy story,  
So far as thou wilt speak it.

*Exeunt*

## ACT IV

### SCENE II. Before the cave of Belarius.

*Enter, from the cave, BELARIUS, GUIDERIUS, ARVIRAGUS, and IMOGEN*

**BELARIUS**  
*\[To IMOGEN]*  
You are not well: remain here in the cave;  
We'll come to you after hunting. /

**ARVIRAGUS**  
*\[To IMOGEN]*  
/ Brother, stay here  
Are we not brothers? /

**IMOGEN**  
So man and man should be;  
But clay and clay differs in dignity,  
Whose dust is both alike. I am very sick.

**GUIDERIUS**  
Go you to hunting; I'll abide with him.

**IMOGEN**  
Stick to your journal course: the breach of custom  
Is breach of all. I am ill, but your being by me  
Cannot amend me; society is no comfort  
To one not sociable: I am not very sick,  
Since I can reason of it. Pray you, trust me here:  
I'll rob none but myself; and let me die,  
Stealing so poorly. /

**GUIDERIUS**  
/ I love thee; I have spoke it  
How much the quantity, the weight as much,  
As I do love my father. /

**BELARIUS**  
/ What! how! how!

**ARVIRAGUS**  
If it be sin to say so, I yoke me  
In my good brother's fault: I know not why  
I love this youth; and I have heard you say,  
Love's reason's without reason.  
Brother, farewell.

**IMOGEN**  
I wish ye sport. /

**ARVIRAGUS**  
/ You health. So please you, sir.

**IMOGEN**  
*\[Aside]*  
I am sick still; heart-sick. Pisanio,  
I'll now taste of thy drug. /  
*\[Swallows some]*

**BELARIUS**  
/ To the field!  
We'll leave you for this time: go in and rest.

**IMOGEN**  
Well or ill, I am bound to you. /

**BELARIUS**  
/ And shalt be ever.

*Exit IMOGEN, to the cave*

This youth, how'er distress'd, appears he hath had  
Good ancestors. /

**ARVIRAGUS**  
/ How angel-like he sings! /

**GUIDERIUS**  
/ I do note  
That grief and patience, rooted in him both,  
Mingle their spurs together. /

**BELARIUS**  
/ Who's there?

*Enter CLOTEN*

**CLOTEN**  
I cannot find those runagates; that villain  
Hath mock'd me. I am faint. /

**BELARIUS**  
/ 'Those runagates!'  
Means he not us? I partly know him: 'tis  
Cloten, the son o' the queen. I fear some ambush!

**GUIDERIUS**  
He is but one: you and my brother search  
What companies are near: pray you, away;  
Let me alone with him. /

*Exeunt BELARIUS and ARVIRAGUS*

**CLOTEN**  
/ Soft! What are you  
That fly me thus? some villain mountaineers?  
I've heard of such. What slave art thou? /

**GUIDERIUS**  
/ A thing  
More slavish did I ne'er than answering  
A slave without a knock. /

**CLOTEN**  
/ Thou'rt a robber,  
A law-breaker, a villain: yield thee, thief.

**GUIDERIUS**  
To who? to thee? What art thou? Have not I  
An arm as big as thine? /

**CLOTEN**  
/ Thou villain base,  
Know'st me not by my clothes? /

**GUIDERIUS**  
/ No, nor thy tailor, rascal,  
Who is thy grandfather: he made those clothes,  
Which, as it seems, make thee. /

**CLOTEN**  
/ Thou precious varlet,  
My tailor made them not. Thou injur'us thief,  
Hear but my name, and tremble. /

**GUIDERIUS**  
/ What's thy name?

**CLOTEN**  
Cloten, thou villain. /

**GUIDERIUS**  
/ Cloten, thou double vill'n,  
Be thy name, I cannot tremble at it:  
Were it Toad, or Adder, Spider,  
'Twould move me sooner. /

**CLOTEN**  
/ To thy further fear,  
Nay, to thy mere confusion, thou shalt know  
I am son to the queen. /

**GUIDERIUS**  
/ I am sorry for 't; not seeming  
So worthy as thy birth /

**CLOTEN**  
/ Art not afeard?

**GUIDERIUS**  
Those that I reverence those I fear, the wise:  
At fools I laugh, not fear them. /

**CLOTEN**  
/ Die the death:  
When I have slain thee with my proper hand,  
I'll follow those that even now fled hence,  
And on the gates of Lud's-town set your heads:  
Yield, rustic mountaineer.

*Exeunt, fighting*

*Re-enter BELARIUS and ARVIRAGUS*

**BELARIUS**  
No companies abroad?

**ARVIRAGUS**  
None in the world: you did mistake him, sure.

**BELARIUS**  
I cannot tell: long is it since I saw him,  
'Twas very Cloten. /

*Re-enter GUIDERIUS, with CLOTEN'S head*

/ What hast thou done?

**GUIDERIUS**  
I am perfect what: cut off one Cloten's head,  
Son to the queen, after his own report;  
Who call'd me traitor, mountaineer, and swore  
With his own single hand he'd take us in  
Displace our heads where--thank the gods!--they grow,  
And set them on Lud's-town. /

**BELARIUS**  
/ We are all undone.

**GUIDERIUS**  
Why, worthy father, what have we to lose,  
But that he swore to take, our lives? The law  
Protects not us: then why should we be tender  
To let an arrogant piece of flesh threat us,  
Play judge and executioner all himself,  
For we do fear the law? What company  
Discover you abroad? /

**ARVIRAGUS**  
/ Let ordinance  
Come as the gods foresay it: howsoe'er,  
My brother hath done well. /

**BELARIUS**  
/ I had no mind  
To hunt this day: the boy Fidele's sickness  
Did make my way long forth. /

**GUIDERIUS**  
/ With his own sword,  
Which he did wave against my throat, I have ta'en  
His head from him: I'll throw't into the creek  
Behind our rock; and let it to the sea,  
And tell the fishes he's the queen's son, Cloten:  
That's all I reck.

*Exit*

**BELARIUS**  
I fear it will be revenged, but, 'tis done:  
We'll hunt no more to-day, nor seek for danger  
Where there's no profit. I prithee, to our rock;  
You and Fidele play the cooks: I'll stay  
Till hasty Polydote return, and bring him  
To dinner presently. /

**ARVIRAGUS**  
/ Poor sick Fidele!  
I'll weringly to him: to gain his colour  
I'ld let a parish of such Clotens' blood,  
And praise myself for charity. /

*Exit*

**BELARIUS**  
/ O thou goddess,  
Thou divine Nature, how thyself thou blazon'st  
In these two princely boys! /

*Re-enter GUIDERIUS*

**GUIDERIUS**  
/ Where's my brother?  
I have sent Cloten's clotpoll down the stream,  
In embassy to his mother: his body's hostage  
For his return. /

*Solemn music*

*Re-enter ARVIRAGUS, with IMOGEN, as dead, bearing her in his arms*

**ARVIRAGUS**  
/ The bird is dead  
That we have made so much on. I had rather  
Have skipp'd from sixteen years of age to sixty,  
To have turn'd my leaping-time into a crutch,  
Than have seen this. /

**GUIDERIUS**  
/ O sweetest, fairest lily!  
My brother wears thee not the one half so well  
As when thou grew'st thyself. /

**BELARIUS**  
/ O melancholy!  
How found you him? /

**ARVIRAGUS**  
/ Stark, as you see:  
Thus smiling, as some fly hid tickled slumber,  
Not as death's dart, being laugh'd at; his right cheek  
Reposing on a cushion. /

**GUIDERIUS**  
/ Why, he but sleeps:  
If he be gone, he'll make his grave a bed;  
With female fairies will his tomb be haunted,  
And worms will not come to thee. /

**ARVIRAGUS**  
/ With fairest flowers  
Whilst summer lasts and I live here, Fidele,  
I'll sweeten thy sad grave: thou shalt not lack  
The flower that's like thy face, pale primrose, nor  
The leaf of eglantine, whom not to slander,  
Out-sweeten'd not thy breath: the ruddock would,  
With charitable bill,--O bill, sore-shaming  
Those rich-left heirs that let their fathers lie  
Without a monument!--bring thee all this;  
Yea, and furr'd moss besides, when flowers are none,  
To winter-ground thy corse. /

**GUIDERIUS**  
/ Prithee, have done;  
And do not play in wench-like words with that  
Which is so serious. Let's bury him,  
And not protract with admiration what  
Is now due debt. To the grave! /

**ARVIRAGUS**  
/ Say, where shall's lay him?

**GUIDERIUS**  
By good Euriphile, our mother. /

**ARVIRAGUS**  
/ We'll speak it, then.

**BELARIUS**  
Great griefs, I see, medicine the less; for  
Cloten's quite forgot. Our foe was princely  
And though you took his life, as being our foe,  
Yet bury him as a prince. /

**GUIDERIUS**  
/ Pray You, fetch him hither.  
Thersites' body is as good as Ajax',  
When neither are alive. /

**ARVIRAGUS**  
/ If you'll go fetch him,  
We'll say our song the whilst. Brother, begin.

*Exit BELARIUS*

**GUIDERIUS**  
*\[Singing]*  
Fear no more the heat o' the sun,  
Nor the furious winter's rages;  
Thou thy worldly task hast done,  
Home art gone, and ta'en thy wages:  
Golden lads and girls all must,  
As chimney-sweepers, come to dust.

**ARVIRAGUS**  
*\[Singing]*  
Fear no more the frown o' the great;  
Thou art past the tyrant's stroke;  
Care no more to clothe and eat;  
To thee the reed is as the oak:  
The sceptre, learning, physic, must  
All follow this, and come to dust.

**GUIDERIUS**  
Fear no more the lightning flash,

**ARVIRAGUS**  
Nor the all-dreaded thunder-stone;

**GUIDERIUS**  
Fear not slander, censure rash;

**ARVIRAGUS**  
Thou hast finish'd joy and moan:

**GUIDERIUS & ARVIRAGUS**  
All lovers young, all lovers must  
Consign to thee, and come to dust.

**GUIDERIUS**  
No exorciser harm thee!

**ARVIRAGUS**  
Nor no witchcraft charm thee!

**GUIDERIUS**  
Ghost unlaid forbear thee!

**ARVIRAGUS**  
Nothing ill come near thee!

**GUIDERIUS & ARVIRAGUS**  
Quiet consummation have;  
And renowned be thy grave!

*Re-enter BELARIUS, with the body of CLOTEN*

**GUIDERIUS**  
We have done our obsequies: come, lay him down.

**BELARIUS**  
Here's a few flowers; but 'bout midnight, more:  
The herbs that have on them cold dew o' the night  
Are strewings fitt'st for graves. Upon their faces.  
You were as flowers, now wither'd: even so  
These herblets shall, which we upon you strew.  
Come on, away: apart upon our knees.  
The ground that gave them first has them again:  
Their pleasures here are past, so is their pain.

*Exeunt BELARIUS, GUIDERIUS, and ARVIRAGUS*

**IMOGEN**  
*\[Awaking]*  
Yes, sir, to Milford-Haven; which is the way?--

*\[Seeing the body of CLOTEN]*  
These flowers are like the pleasures of the world;  
This bloody man, the care on't. I hope I dream;  
For so I thought I was a cave-keeper,  
And cook to honest creatures: but 'tis not so;  
'Twas but a bolt of nothing, shot at nothing,  
Which the brain makes of fumes: our very eyes  
Are sometimes like our judgments, blind. Good faith,  
I tremble stiff with fear: but if there be  
Yet left in heaven as small a drop of pity  
As a wren's eye, fear'd gods, a part of it!  
The dream's here still: even when I wake, it is  
Without me, as within me; not imagined, felt.  
A headless man! The garments of Posthumus!  
I know the shape of's leg: this is his hand;  
His foot Mercurial; his Martial thigh;  
The brawns of Hercules: but his Jovial face  
Murder in heaven?--How!--'Tis gone. Pisanio,  
All curses madded Hecuba gave the Greeks,  
And mine to boot, be darted on thee! Thou,  
Conspired with that irregulous devil, Cloten,  
Hast here cut off my lord. To write and read  
Be henceforth treacherous! Damn'd Pisanio  
Hath with his forged letters,--damn'd Pisanio--  
From this most bravest vessel of the world  
Struck the main-top! O Posthumus! alas,  
Where's thy head? where's that? Ay me! where's that?  
Pisanio might have kill'd thee at the heart,  
And left this head on. How should this be? Pisanio?  
'Tis he and Cloten: malice and lucre in them  
Have laid this woe here. O, 'tis pregnant, pregnant!  
The drug he gave me, which he said was precious  
And cordial to me, have I not found it  
Murderous to the senses? That confirms it home:  
This is Pisanio's deed, and Cloten's: O!  
Give colour to my pale cheek with thy blood,  
That we the horrider may seem to those  
Which chance to find us: O, my lord, my lord!  
*\[Falls on the body]*

*Enter LUCIUS and other Officers*

**Captain**  
To them the legions garrison'd in Gailia,  
After your will, have cross'd the sea, attending  
You here at Milford-Haven with your ships:  
They are in readiness.

**CAIUS LUCIUS**  
But what from Rome? When expect you them?

**Captain**  
With the next ben'fit o' the wind. /

**CAIUS LUCIUS**  
/ This forw'dness  
Makes our hopes fair. Command our present numbers  
Be muster'd; bid the captains look to't.  
Soft, ho! How! a page!  
Or dead, or sleeping on him? But dead rather;  
For nature doth abhor to make his bed  
With the defunct, or sleep upon the dead.  
Let's see the boy's face. Young one,  
Inform us of thy fortunes, for it seems  
They crave to be demanded. Who is this  
Thou makest thy bloody pillow? What's thy interest  
In this sad wreck? What art thou? /

**IMOGEN**  
/ I am nothing: or if not,  
Nothing to be were better. This was my master,  
A very valiant Briton and a good,  
That here by mountaineers lies slain. Alas!  
There is no more such masters! /

**CAIUS LUCIUS**  
/ Thy name? /

**IMOGEN**  
/ Fidele, sir.

**CAIUS LUCIUS**  
Thou dost approve thyself the very same.  
Wilt take thy chance with me? I will not say  
Thou shalt be so well master'd, but, be sure,  
No less beloved. The Roman emperor's letters,  
Sent by a consul to me, should not sooner  
Than thine own worth prefer thee: go with me.

**IMOGEN**  
I'll follow, sir. But first, an't please the gods,  
I'll hide my master from the flies, as deep  
As these poor pickaxes can dig;  
And on it said a century of prayers,  
Such as I can, twice o'er, I'll weep and sigh;  
And leaving so his service, follow you.

**CAIUS LUCIUS**  
Ay, good youth!  
And rather father thee than master thee.  
The boy hath taught us manly duties: let us  
Find out the prettiest daisied plot we can,  
And make him with our pikes and partisans  
A grave: come, arm him. Boy, he is preferr'd  
By thee to us, and he shall be interr'd  
As soldiers can. Be cheerful; wipe thine eyes  
Some falls are means the happier to arise.

*Exeunt*

### SCENE III. A room in Cymbeline's palace.

*Enter CYMBELINE, Lords, PISANIO, and Attendants*

**CYMBELINE**  
A fever with the absence of her son,  
A madness, of which her life's in danger. Heavens,  
How deeply you at once do touch me! Imogen,  
The great part of my comfort, gone; my queen  
Upon a desperate bed, and in a time  
When fearful wars point at me; her son gone,  
So needful for this present: it strikes me, past  
The hope of comfort. But for thee, fellow,  
Who needs must know of her departure and  
Dost seem so ignorant, we'll enforce it from thee  
By a sharp torture. /

**PISANIO**  
/ Sir, my life is yours;  
I humbly set it at your will; but, for my mistress,  
I nothing know where she remains, why gone,  
Nor when she purposes return. Beseech your highness,  
Hold me your loyal servant. /

**First Lord**  
/ Good my liege,  
The day that she was missing he was here:  
I dare be bound he's true and shall perform  
All parts of his subjection loyally. For Cloten,  
There wants no diligence in seeking him,  
And will, no doubt, be found.

**CYMBELINE**  
The time is troublesome.

*\[To PISANIO]*  
We'll slip you for a season; but our jealousy  
Does yet depend. /

**First Lord**  
/ So please your majesty,  
The Roman legions, all from Gallia drawn,  
Are landed on your coast, with a supply  
Of Roman gentlemen, by the senate sent.

**CYMBELINE**  
Now for the counsel of my son and queen!  
I am amazed with matter. Let's withdraw;  
And meet the time as it seeks us. We fear not  
What can from Italy annoy us; but  
We grieve at chances here. Away!

*Exeunt all but PISANIO*

**PISANIO**  
I heard no letter from my master since  
I wrote him Imogen was slain: 'tis strange:  
Nor hear I from my mistress who did promise  
To yield me often tidings: neither know I  
What is betide to Cloten; but remain  
Perplex'd in all. The heavens still must work.  
Wherein I am false I am honest; not true, to be true.  
These present wars shall find I love my country,  
Even to the note o' the king, or I'll fall in them.  
All other doubts, by time let them be clear'd:  
Fortune brings in some boats that are not steer'd.

*Exit*

### SCENE IV. Wales: before the cave of Belarius.

*Enter BELARIUS, GUIDERIUS, and ARVIRAGUS.*

**BELARIUS**  
We'll higher to the mountains; there secure us.  
To the king's party there's no going: newness  
Of Cloten's death--we being not known, not muster'd  
Among the bands--may drive us to a render  
Where we have lived, and so extort from's that  
Which we have done, whose answer would be death  
Drawn on with torture. O, I am known  
Of many in the army: many years,  
Though Cloten then but young, you see, not wore him  
From my remembrance. And, besides, the king  
Hath not deserved my service nor your loves;  
Who find in my exile the want of breeding,  
The certainty of this hard life; aye hopeless  
To have the courtesy your cradle promised,  
But to be still hot summer's tamings and  
The shrinking slaves of winter. /

**GUIDERIUS**  
/ Than be so  
Better to cease to be. Pray, sir, to the army:  
I and my brother are not known; yourself  
So out of thought, and thereto so o'ergrown,  
Cannot be question'd. /

**ARVIRAGUS**  
/ By this sun that shines,  
I'll thither: what thing is it that I never  
Did see man die! scarce ever look'd on blood,  
But that of coward hares, hot goats, and venison!  
Never bestrid a horse, save one that had  
A rider like myself, who ne'er wore rowel  
Nor iron on his heel! I am ashamed  
To look upon the holy sun, to have  
The benefit of his blest beams, remaining  
So long a poor unknown. /

**GUIDERIUS**  
/ By heavens, I'll go:  
If you will bless me, sir, and give me leave,  
I'll take the better care, but if you will not,  
The hazard therefore due fall on me by  
The hands of Romans!

*\[Aside]*  
The time seems long; their blood thinks scorn,  
Till it fly out and show them princes born.

*Exeunt*

## ACT V

### SCENE I. Britain. The Roman camp.

*Enter POSTHUMUS, with a bloody handkerchief*

**POSTHUMUS LEONATUS**  
Yea, bloody cloth, I'll keep thee, for I wish'd  
Thou shouldst be colour'd thus. You married ones,  
If each of you should take this course, how many  
Must murder wives much better than themselves  
For wrying but a little! O Pisanio!  
Every good servant does not all commands:  
No bond but to do just ones. Gods! if you  
Should have ta'en vengeance on my faults, I never  
Had lived to put on this: I am brought hither  
Among the Italian gentry, and to fight  
Against my lady's kingdom: 'tis enough  
That, Britain, I have kill'd thy mistress; peace!  
I'll give no wound to thee. Therefore, good heavens,  
Hear patiently my purpose: I'll disrobe me  
Of these Italian weeds and suit myself  
As does a Briton peasant: so I'll fight  
Against the part I come with; so I'll die  
For thee, O Imogen, even for whom my life  
Is every breath a death; and thus, unknown,  
Pitied nor hated, to the face of peril  
Myself I'll dedicate. Let me make men know  
More valour in me than my habits show.  
Gods, put the strength o' the Leonati in me!  
To shame the guise o' the world, I will begin  
The fashion, less without and more within.

*Exit*

### SCENE II. Field of battle between the British and Roman camps.

*Enter, from one side, LUCIUS, IACHIMO, and the Roman Army: from the other  
side, the British Army; POSTHUMUS LEONATUS following, like a poor soldier.*

*They march over and go out. Then enter again, in skirmish, IACHIMO and  
POSTHUMUS LEONATUS he vanquisheth and disarmeth IACHIMO, and then leaves him*

**IACHIMO**  
The heaviness and guilt within my bosom  
Takes off my manhood: I have belied a lady,  
The princess of this country, and the air on't  
Revengingly enfeebles me; or could this carl,  
A very drudge of nature's, have subdued me  
In my profession? Knighthoods and honours, borne  
As I wear mine, are titles but of scorn.  
If that thy gentry, Britain, go before  
This lout as he exceeds our lords, the odds  
Is that we scarce are men and you are gods.

*Exit*

*The battle continues; the Britons fly; CYMBELINE is taken: then enter, to  
his rescue, BELARIUS, GUIDERIUS, and ARVIRAGUS*

*Re-enter POSTHUMUS LEONATUS, and seconds the Britons: they rescue  
CYMBELINE, and exeunt. Then re-enter LUCIUS, and IACHIMO, with IMOGEN*

**CAIUS LUCIUS**  
It is a day turn'd strangely: or betimes  
Let's reinforce, or fly.

*Exeunt*

### SCENE III. Another part of the field.

*Enter POSTHUMUS LEONATUS*

**POSTHUMUS LEONATUS**  
To-day how many would have given their honours  
To have saved their carcasses! took heel to do't,  
And yet died too! I, in mine own woe charm'd,  
Could not find death where I did hear him groan,  
Nor feel him where he struck: being an ugly monster,  
'Tis strange he hides him in fresh cups, soft beds,  
Sweet words; or hath more ministers than we  
That draw his knives i' the war. Well, I will find him  
For being now a favourer to the Briton,  
No more a Briton, I have resumed again  
The part I came in: fight I will no more,  
But yield me to the veriest hind that shall  
Once touch my shoulder. Great the slaughter is  
Here made by the Roman; great the answer be  
Britons must take. For me, my ransom's death;  
On either side I come to spend my breath;  
Which neither here I'll keep nor bear again,  
But end it by some means for Imogen.

*Enter a British Captain*

**Captain**  
Stand! who's there?

**POSTHUMUS LEONATUS**  
A Roman, who'd not now been drooping here.

*The Captain seizes LEONATUS*

### SCENE V. Cymbeline's tent.

*Enter CYMBELINE, BELARIUS, GUIDERIUS, ARVIRAGUS, PISANIO, Lords, Officers, and Attendants*

**CYMBELINE**  
Stand by my side, you whom the gods have made  
Preservers of my throne. Woe is my heart  
That the poor soldier that so richly fought,  
Whose rags shamed gilded arms, whose naked breast  
Stepp'd before larges of proof, cannot be found:  
He shall be happy that can find him, if  
Our grace can make him so. No tidings of him?

**PISANIO**  
He hath been search'd among the dead and living,  
But no trace of him. /

**CYMBELINE**  
/ To my grief, I am  
The heir of his reward; /

*\[To BELARIUS, GUIDERIUS, and ARVIRAGUS]*  
/ which I will add  
To you, the liver, heart and brain of Britain,  
By whom I grant she lives.  
Arise my knights o' the battle: I create you  
Companions to our person and will fit you  
With dignities becoming your estates.

*Enter CORNELIUS and Ladies*

There's business in these faces. Why so sadly  
Greet you our victory? /

**CORNELIUS**  
/ Hail, great king!  
To sour your happiness, I must report  
The queen is dead. /

**CYMBELINE**  
/ Who worse than a physician  
Would this report become? How ended she?

**CORNELIUS**  
With horror, madly dying, like her life,  
Which, being cruel to the world, concluded  
Most cruel to herself. What she confess'd  
I will report, so please you: these her women  
Can trip me, if I err; who with wet cheeks  
Were present when she finish'd. /

**CYMBELINE**  
/ Prithee, say.

**CORNELIUS**  
First, she confess'd she never loved you, only  
Affected greatness got by you, not you.  
Your daughter, whom she bore in hand to love  
With such integrity, she did confess  
Was as a scorpion to her sight; whose life,  
But that her flight prevented it, she had  
Ta'en off by poison. She did confess she had  
For you a mortal mineral; which, being took,  
Should by the minute feed on life and lingering  
By inches waste you: in which time she purposed,  
By watching, weeping, tendance, kissing, to  
O'ercome you with her show, and in time,  
When she had fitted you with her craft, to work  
Her son into the adoption of the crown:  
But, failing of her end by his strange absence,  
Grew shameless-desperate; open'd, in despite  
Of heaven and men, her purposes; repented  
The evils she hatch'd were not effected; so  
Despairing died. /

**CYMBELINE**  
/ Heard you all this, her women?

**First Lady**  
We did, so please your highness. /

**CYMBELINE**  
/ Mine eyes  
Were not in fault, for she was beautiful;  
Mine ears, that heard her flattery; nor my heart,  
That thought her like her seeming; it'd been vicious  
To have mistrusted her: yet, O my daughter!  
That it was folly in me, thou mayst say,  
And prove it in thy feeling. Heaven mend all!

*Enter LUCIUS, IACHIMO, the Soothsayer, and other Roman Prisoners, guarded;  
POSTHUMUS LEONATUS behind, and IMOGEN*

Thou comest not, Caius, now for tribute that  
The Britons have razed out, though with the loss  
Of many a bold one; whose kinsmen have made suit  
That their good souls may be appeased with slaughter  
Of you their captives, which ourself have granted:  
So think of your estate.

**CAIUS LUCIUS**  
Consider, sir, the chance of war: the day  
Was yours by accident; had it gone with us,  
We should not, when th'blood was cool, have threaten'd  
Our prisoners with the sword. But since the gods  
Will have it thus, that nothing but our lives  
May be call'd ransom, this one thing only  
I will entreat; my boy, a Briton born,  
Let him be ransom'd: let his virtue join  
With my request, which I make bold your highness  
Cannot deny; he hath done no Briton harm,  
Though he have served a Roman: save him, sir,  
And spare no blood beside. /

**CYMBELINE**  
/ I have surely seen him:  
His favour is familiar to me. Boy,  
Thou hast look'd thyself into my grace,  
And art mine own. I know not why, wherefore,  
To say 'live, boy:' ne'er thank thy master; live:  
And ask of Cymbeline what boon thou wilt,  
Fitting my bounty and thy state, I'll give it;  
Yea, though thou do demand a prisoner,  
The noblest ta'en. /

**IMOGEN**  
/ I humbly thank your highness.

**CAIUS LUCIUS**  
I do not bid thee beg my life, good lad;  
And yet I know thou wilt. /

**IMOGEN**  
/ No, no: alack,  
I'll tell you, sir, in private, if you please  
To give me hearing. /

**CYMBELINE**  
/ Ay, with all my heart,  
And lend my best attention.

*CYMBELINE and IMOGEN converse apart*

**BELARIUS**  
Is not this boy revived from death?

**GUIDERIUS**  
The same dead thing alive.

**BELARIUS**  
Peace, peace! were 't he, I am sure  
He would have spoke to us. /

**GUIDERIUS**  
/ But we saw him dead.

**BELARIUS**  
Be silent; let's see further. /

**PISANIO**  
*\[Aside]*  
/ It is my mistress:  
Since she is living, let the time run on  
To good or bad. /

*CYMBELINE and IMOGEN come forward*

**CYMBELINE**  
*\[To IACHIMO]*  
/ Sir, step you forth;  
Give answer to this boy, and do it freely.

**IMOGEN**  
My boon is, that this gentleman may render  
Of whom he had this ring. /

**POSTHUMUS LEONATUS**  
*\[Aside]*  
/ What's that to him?

**IACHIMO**  
I am glad to be constrain'd to utter that  
Which torments me to conceal. By villany  
I got this ring: 'twas Leonatus' jewel;  
Whom thou didst banish; and--which more may grieve thee,  
As it doth me--a nobler sir ne'er lived  
'Twixt sky and ground. Wilt thou hear more, my lord?

**CYMBELINE**  
All that belongs to this.

**IACHIMO**  
That paragon, thy daughter,-the good Posthumus--

**CYMBELINE**  
Nay, nay, to the purpose.

**IACHIMO**  
Your daughter's chastity--there it begins.  
He spake of her, as Dian had hot dreams,  
And she alone were cold: whereat I, wretch,  
Made scruple of his praise; and wager'd with him  
Pieces of gold 'gainst this which then he wore  
Upon his honour'd finger, to attain  
In suit the place of's bed and win this ring  
By hers and mine adultery. He, true knight,  
No lesser of her honour confident  
Than I did truly find her, stakes this ring;  
And would so, had it been a carbuncle  
Of Phoebus' wheel, and might so safely, had it  
Been all the worth of's car. Away to Britain  
Post I in this design: well may you, sir,  
Remember me at court; where I was taught  
Of your chaste daughter the wide difference  
'Twixt amorous and villanous. Being thus quench'd  
Of hope, not longing, mine Italian brain  
'Gan in your duller Britain operate  
Most vilely; for my vantage, excellent:  
And, to be brief, my practise so prevail'd,  
That I return'd with simular proof enough  
To make the noble Leonatus mad,  
By wounding his belief in her renown  
With tokens thus, and thus; averting notes  
Of chamber-hanging, pictures, this her bracelet,--  
O cunning, how I got it!--nay, some marks  
Of secret on her person, that he could not  
But think her bond of chastity quite crack'd,  
I having ta'en the forfeit. Whereupon--  
Methinks, I see him now-- /

**POSTHUMUS LEONATUS**  
*\[Advancing]*  
/ Ay, so thou dost,  
Italian fiend! Ay me, most credulous fool,  
Egregious murderer, thief, any thing  
That's due to all the villains past, in being,  
To come! O, give me cord, or knife, or poison,  
Some upright justicer! Thou, king, send out  
For torturers ingenious: it is I  
That all the abhorred things o' the earth amend  
By being worse than they. I am Posthumus,  
That kill'd thy daughter:--villain-like, I lie--  
That caused a lesser villain than myself,  
A sacrilegious thief, to do't: the temple  
Of virtue was she; yea, and she herself.  
Spit, and throw stones, cast mire upon me, set  
The dogs o' the street to bay me: every villain  
Be call'd Posthumus Leonitus; and  
Be villany less than 'twas! O Imogen!  
My queen, my life, my wife! O Imogen,  
Imogen, Imogen! /

**IMOGEN**  
/ Peace, my lord; hear, hear--

**POSTHUMUS LEONATUS**  
Shall's have a play of this? Thou scornful page,  
There lie thy part. /  
*\[Striking her: she falls]*

**PISANIO**  
/ O, gentlemen, help!  
Mine and your mistress! O, my lord Posthumus!  
You ne'er kill'd Imogen til now. Help, help!  
Mine honour'd lady!

**CYMBELINE**  
If this be so, the gods do mean to strike me  
To death with mortal joy. /

**PISANIO**  
/ How fares thy mistress?

**IMOGEN**  
O, get thee from my sight;  
Thou gavest me poison: dangerous fellow, hence!  
Breathe not where princes are. /

**CYMBELINE**  
/ The tune of Imogen! /

**PISANIO**  
/ Lady,  
The gods throw stones of sulphur on me, if  
That box I gave you was not thought by me  
A precious thing: I had it from the queen.

**CYMBELINE**  
New matter still? /

**IMOGEN**  
/ It poison'd me. /

**CORNELIUS**  
/ O gods!  
I left out one thing which the queen confess'd.  
Which must approve thee honest: 'If Pisanio  
Have,' said she, 'given his mistress that confection  
Which I gave him for cordial, she is served  
As I would serve a rat.' /

**CYMBELINE**  
/ What's this, Cornelio?

**CORNELIUS**  
The queen, sir, very oft importuned me  
To temper poisons for her, still pretending  
The satisfaction of her knowledge only  
In killing creatures vile, as cats and dogs,  
Of no esteem: I, dreading that her purpose  
Was of more danger, did compound for her  
A certain stuff, which, being ta'en, would cease  
The present power of life, but in short time  
All offices of nature should again  
Do their due functions. Have you ta'en of it?

**IMOGEN**  
Most like I did, for I was dead. /

**BELARIUS**  
/ My boys,  
There was our error. /

**GUIDERIUS**  
/ This is, sure, Fidele.

**IMOGEN**  
Why did you throw your wedded lady from you?  
Think that you are upon a rock; and now  
Throw me again. /  
*\[Embracing him]*

**POSTHUMUS LEONATUS**  
Hang there like a fruit, my soul,  
Till the tree die! /

**CYMBELINE**  
/ How now, my flesh, my child!  
What, makest thou me a dullard in this act?  
Wilt thou not speak to me? /

**IMOGEN**  
*\[Kneeling]*  
/ Your blessing, sir.

**BELARIUS**  
*\[To GUIDERIUS and ARVIRAGUS]*  
Though you did love this youth, I blame ye not:  
You had a motive for't. /

**CYMBELINE**  
/ My tears that fall  
Prove holy water on thee! Imogen,  
Thy mother's dead. /

**IMOGEN**  
/ I am sorry for't, my lord.

**CYMBELINE**  
O, she was nought; and long of her it was  
That we meet here so strangely: but her son  
Is gone, we know not how nor where.

**GUIDERIUS**  
Let me end the story: I slew him there.

**CYMBELINE**  
Marry, the gods forfend!  
I would not thy good deeds should from my lips  
Pluck a bard sentence: prithee, valiant youth,  
Deny't again. /

**GUIDERIUS**  
/ I have spoke it, and I did it.

**CYMBELINE**  
He was a prince.

**GUIDERIUS**  
A most incivil one: the wrongs he did me  
Were nothing prince-like; I cut off his head.

**IMOGEN**  
That headless man  
I thought had been my lord. /

**CYMBELINE**  
/ Bind the offender,  
And take him from our presence. /

**BELARIUS**  
/ Stay, sir king:  
This man is better than the man he slew,  
As well descended as thyself; and hath  
More of thee merited than a band of Clotens  
Had ever scar for. /

**CYMBELINE**  
/ Why, old soldier,  
Wilt thou undo the worth thou art unpaid for,  
By tasting of our wrath? How of descent  
As good as we? /

**BELARIUS**  
/ We will die all three:  
I am too blunt and saucy: here's my knee:  
Ere I arise, I will prefer my sons;  
Then spare not the old father. Mighty sir,  
These two young gentlemen, that call me father  
And think they are my sons, are none of mine;  
They are the issue of your loins, my liege,  
And blood of your begetting. /

**CYMBELINE**  
/ How! my issue!

**BELARIUS**  
So sure as you your father's. I, old Morgan,  
Am that Belarius whom you sometime banish'd:  
Your pleasure was my mere offence, my punishment  
Itself, and all my treason; that I suffer'd  
Was all the harm I did. These gentle princes--  
For such and so they are--these twenty years  
Have I train'd up. But, gracious sir,  
Here are your sons again; and I must lose  
Two of the sweet'st companions in the world.  
The benediction of these covering heavens  
Fall on their heads like dew! for they are worthy  
To inlay heaven with stars. /

**CYMBELINE**  
/ I lost my children:  
If these be they, I know not how to wish  
A pair of worthier sons. /

**BELARIUS**  
/ Be pleased awhile.  
This gentleman, whom I call Polydore,  
Most worthy prince, as yours, is true Guiderius:  
This gentleman, my Cadwal, Arviragus,  
Your younger princely son. /

**CYMBELINE**  
/ Guiderius had  
Upon his neck a mole, a sanguine star;  
It was a mark of wonder. /

**BELARIUS**  
/ This is he;  
Who hath upon him still that natural stamp:  
It was wise nature's end in the donation,  
To be his evidence now. /

**CYMBELINE**  
/ O, what, am I  
A mother to the birth of three? Ne'er mother  
Rejoiced deliverance more. O Imogen,  
Thou hast lost by this a kingdom. /

**IMOGEN**  
/ No, my lord;  
I have got two worlds by 't. O my gentle brothers,  
Have we thus met? O, never say hereafter  
But I am truest speaker you call'd me brother,  
When I was but your sister; I you brothers,  
When ye were so indeed. /

**CYMBELINE**  
/ Did you e'er meet?

**ARVIRAGUS**  
Ay, my good lord. /

**GUIDERIUS**  
/ And at first meeting loved.

**CYMBELINE**  
O rare instinct!  
When shall I hear all through? This fierce abridgement  
Hath to it circumstantial branches, which  
Distinction should be rich in. Where? how lived You?  
And when came you to serve our Roman captive?  
How parted with your brothers? how first met them?  
Why fled you from the court? and whither? These,  
And your three motives to the battle, with  
I know not how much more, should be demanded;  
And all the other by-dependencies,  
From chance to chance: but nor the time nor place  
Will serve our long inter'gatories. See,  
Posthumus anchors upon Imogen,  
And she, like harmless lightning, throws her eye  
On him, her brother, me, her master, hitting  
Each object with a joy: the counterchange  
Is severally in all. Let's quit this ground,  
And smoke the temple with our sacrifices.

*\[To BELARIUS]*  
Thou art my brother; so we'll hold thee ever.

**IMOGEN**  
You are my father too, and did relieve me,  
To see this gracious season. /

**CYMBELINE**  
/ All o'erjoy'd,  
Save these in bonds: let them be joyful too,  
For they shall taste our comfort. /

**IMOGEN**  
/ My good master,  
I will yet do you service. /

**CAIUS LUCIUS**  
/ Happy be you!

**CYMBELINE**  
The forlorn soldier, that so nobly fought,  
He would have well becomed this place, and graced  
The thankings of a king. /

**POSTHUMUS LEONATUS**  
/ I am, sir,  
The soldier that did company these three  
In poor beseeming; 'twas a fitment for  
The purpose I then follow'd. That I was he,  
Speak, Iachimo: I had you down and might  
Have made you finish. /

**IACHIMO**  
*\[Kneeling]*  
/ I am down again:  
But now my heavy conscience sinks my knee,  
As then your force did. Take that life, beseech you,  
Which I so often owe: but your ring first;  
And here the bracelet of the truest princess  
That ever swore her faith. /

**POSTHUMUS LEONATUS**  
/ Kneel not to me:  
The power that I have on you is, to spare you;  
The malice towards you to forgive you: live,  
And deal with others better. /

**CYMBELINE**  
/ Nobly doom'd!  
We'll learn our freeness of a son-in-law;  
Pardon's the word to all. /

**ARVIRAGUS**  
/ You holp us, sir,  
As you did mean indeed to be our brother;  
Joy'd are we that you are.

**CYMBELINE**  
My peace we will begin. And, Caius Lucius,  
Although the victor, we submit to Caesar,  
And to the Roman empire; promising  
To pay our wonted tribute, from the which  
We were dissuaded by our wicked queen;  
Whom heavens, in justice, both on her and hers,  
Have laid most heavy hand. Laud we the gods;  
And let our crooked smokes climb to their nostrils  
From our blest altars. Publish we this peace  
To all our subjects. Set we forward: let  
A Roman and a British ensign wave  
Friendly together: so through Lud's-town march:  
And in the temple of great Jupiter  
Our peace we'll ratify; seal it with feasts.  
Set on there! Never was a war did cease,  
Ere bloody hands were wash'd, with such a peace.

*Exeunt*

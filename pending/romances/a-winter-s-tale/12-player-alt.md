## ACT I

### SCENE I. Antechamber in LEONTES' palace.

*Enter CAMILLO and ARCHIDAMUS*

**ARCHIDAMUS**  
If you shall chance, Camillo, to visit Bohemia, on  
the like occasion whereon my services are now on  
foot, you shall see, as I have said, great  
difference betwixt our Bohemia and your Sicilia.

**CAMILLO**  
I think, this coming summer, the King of Sicilia  
means to pay Bohemia the visitation which he justly owes him.

**ARCHIDAMUS**  
Wherein our entertainment shall shame us we will be  
justified in our loves; We will give you sleepy drinks,  
that your senses, unintelligent of our insufficience,  
may, though they cannot praise us, as little accuse  
us.

**CAMILLO**  
You pay a great deal too dear for what's given freely.  
Sicilia cannot show himself over-kind to Bohemia.  
They were trained together in their childhoods; and  
there rooted betwixt them then such an affection,  
which cannot choose but branch now.  
The heavens continue their loves!

**ARCHIDAMUS**  
I think there is not in the world either malice or  
matter to alter it. You have an unspeakable  
comfort of your young prince Mamillius: it is a  
gentleman of the greatest promise that ever came  
into my note.

**CAMILLO**  
I very well agree with you in the hopes of him: it  
is a gallant child; one that indeed physics the  
subject, makes old hearts fresh: they that went on  
crutches ere he was born desire yet their life to  
see him a man.

**ARCHIDAMUS**  
If the king had no son, they would desire to live  
on crutches till he had one.

*Exeunt*

### SCENE II. A room of state in the same.

*Enter LEONTES, HERMIONE, MAMILLIUS, POLIXENES, and CAMILLO*

**POLIXENES**  
Nine changes of the watery star hath been  
The shepherd's note since we have left our throne  
Without a burthen: time as long again  
Would be find up, my brother, with our thanks;  
And yet we should, for perpetuity,  
Go hence in debt: and therefore, like a cipher,  
Yet standing in rich place, I multiply  
With one 'We thank you' many thousands moe  
That go before it. /

**LEONTES**  
/ Stay your thanks a while;  
And pay them when you part. /

**POLIXENES**  
/ Sir, that's tomorrow.  
I am question'd by my fears, of what may chance  
Or breed upon our absence; that may blow  
No sneaping winds at home, to make us say  
'This is put forth too truly:' besides, I have stay'd  
To tire your royalty. /

**LEONTES**  
/ We are tougher, brother,  
Than you can put us to't. /

**POLIXENES**  
/ Very sooth, tomorrow.

**LEONTES**  
We'll part the time between's then; and in that  
I'll no gainsaying. /

**POLIXENES**  
/ Press me not, beseech you, so.  
There is no tongue that moves, none, none i' the world,  
So soon as yours could win me: so it should now,  
Were there necessity in your request, although  
'Twere needful I denied it. My affairs  
Do even drag me homeward: Farewell, our brother.

**LEONTES**  
Tongue-tied, our queen? speak you.

**HERMIONE**  
I had thought, sir, to have held my peace until  
You have drawn oaths from him not to stay. You, sir,  
Charge him too coldly. Tell him, you are sure  
All in Bohemia's well; this satisfaction  
The bygone day proclaim'd: say this to him,  
He's beat from his best ward. /

**LEONTES**  
/ Well said, Hermione.

**HERMIONE**  
To tell, he longs to see his son, were strong:  
But let him say so then, and let him go;  
Yet of your royal presence I'll adventure  
The borrow of a week. When at Bohemia  
You take my lord, I'll give him my commission  
To let him there a month behind the gest  
Prefix'd for's parting: yet, good deed, Leontes,  
I love thee not a jar o' the clock behind  
What lady--she her lord. You'll stay? /

**POLIXENES**  
/ No, madam.

**HERMIONE**  
Nay, but you will? /

**POLIXENES**  
I may not, ver'ly. /

**HERMIONE**  
/ Verily!  
You put me off with limber vows; but I,  
Though you would seek to unsphere the stars with oaths,  
Should yet say 'Sir, no going.' Verily,  
You shall not go: a lady's 'Verily' 's  
As potent as a lord's. Will you go yet?  
Force me to keep you as a prisoner,  
Not like a guest; so you shall pay your fees  
When you depart, and save your thanks. How say you?  
My prisoner? or my guest? by your dread 'Verily,'  
One of them you shall be. /

**POLIXENES**  
/ Your guest, then, madam:  
To be your prisoner should import offending;  
Which is for me less easy to commit  
Than you to punish. /

**HERMIONE**  
/ Not your jailor, then,  
But your kind hostess. /

**LEONTES**  
/ Is he won yet?

**HERMIONE**  
He'll stay my lord. /

**LEONTES**  
/ At my request he would not.  
Hermione, my dearest, thou never spokest  
To better purpose. /

**HERMIONE**  
/ Never? /

**LEONTES**  
/ Never, but once.

**HERMIONE**  
What! have I twice said well? when was't before?  
I prithee tell me; cram's with praise, and make's  
As fat as tame things: one good deed dying tongueless  
Slaughters a thousand waiting upon that.  
Our praises are our wages: you may ride's  
With one soft kiss a thousand furlongs ere  
With spur we beat an acre. But to the goal:  
My last good deed was to entreat his stay:  
What was my first? it has an elder sister,  
Or I mistake you: O, would her name were Grace!  
But once before I spoke to the purpose: when?  
Nay, let me have't; I long. /

**LEONTES**  
/ Why, that was when  
Three crabbed months had sour'd themselves to death,  
Ere I could make thee open thy white hand  
And clap thyself my love: then didst thou utter  
'I am yours forever.' /

**HERMIONE**  
/ 'Tis grace indeed.  
Why, lo you now, I have spoke to the purpose twice:  
The one forever earn'd a royal husband;  
The other for some while a friend. /

**LEONTES**  
*\[Aside]*  
/ Too hot, too hot!  
To mingle friendship far is mingling bloods.  
I have tremor cordis on me: my heart dances;  
But not for joy; not joy. This entertainment  
May a free face put on, derive a liberty  
From heartiness, from bounty, fertile bosom,  
And well become the agent; 't may, I grant;  
But to be paddling palms and pinching fingers,  
As now they are, and making practised smiles,  
As in a looking-glass, and then to sigh, as 'twere  
The mort o' the deer; O, that is entertainment  
My bosom likes not, nor my brows! Mamillius,  
Art thou my boy? /

**MAMILLIUS**  
/ Ay, my good lord. /

**LEONTES**  
/ I' fecks!  
Why, that's my bawcock. What, hast smutch'd thy nose?  
They say it is a copy out of mine. Come, captain,  
We must be neat; still virginalling  
Upon his palm!--How now, you wanton calf!  
Art thou my calf? /

**MAMILLIUS**  
/ Yes, if you will, my lord.

**LEONTES**  
Thou want'st a rough pash and the shoots that I have,  
To be full like me: yet they say we are  
Almost as like as eggs; women say so,  
That will say anything but were they false  
As dice are to be wish'd by one that fixes  
No bourn 'twixt his and mine, yet were it true  
To say this boy were like me. Come, sir page,  
Look on me with your welkin eye: sweet villain!  
Thou dost make possible things not so held,  
Communicatest with dreams;--how can this be?--  
Thou mayst co-join with something; and thou dost,  
And that to the infection of my brains  
And hardening of my brows. /

**POLIXENES**  
/ What means Sicilia?

**HERMIONE**  
You look as if you held a brow of much distraction  
Are you moved, my lord? /

**LEONTES**  
/ No, in good earnest.  
How sometimes nature will betray its folly,  
Its tenderness, and make itself a pastime  
To harder bosoms! Looking on the lines  
Of my boy's face, methoughts I did recoil  
Twenty-three years, and saw myself unbreech'd,  
How like, methought, I then was to this kernel,  
This squash, this gentleman. My brother,  
Are you so fond of your young prince as we  
Do seem to be of ours? /

**POLIXENES**  
/ If at home, sir,  
He's all my exercise, my mirth, my matter,  
Now my sworn friend and then mine enemy,  
And with his varying childness cures in me  
Thoughts that would thick my blood. /

**LEONTES**  
/ So stands this squire  
Officed with me: we two will walk, my lord,  
And leave you to your graver steps. Hermione,  
How thou lovest us, show in our brother's welcome.  
Next to thyself and my young rover, he's  
Apparent to my heart. /

**HERMIONE**  
/ If you would seek us,  
We are yours i' the garden: shall's attend you there?

**LEONTES**  
To your own bents dispose you: you'll be found,  
Be you beneath the sky. Go to, go to!  
How she holds up the neb, the bill to him!  
And arms her with the boldness of a wife  
To her allowing husband! /

*Exeunt POLIXENES and HERMIONE*

/ Gone already!  
Inch-thick, knee-deep, o'er head and ears a fork'd one!  
Go, play, boy, play: thy mother plays, and I  
Play too, but so disgraced a part, whose issue  
Will hiss me to my grave: contempt and clamor  
Will be my knell. Go, play, boy, play.  
There have been,  
Or I am much deceived, cuckolds ere now;  
Now while I speak this, holds his wife by the arm,  
That little thinks she has been sluiced in's absence  
And his pond fish'd by his next neighbor, by  
Sir Smile, his neighbor: nay, there's comfort in't  
Whiles other men have gates and those gates open'd,  
As mine, against their will. Should all despair  
That have revolting wives, the tenth of mankind  
Would hang themselves. Physic for't there is none;  
It is a bawdy planet, that will strike  
Where 'tis predominant. How now, boy!

**MAMILLIUS**  
I am like you, they say.

**LEONTES**  
Why that's some comfort. What, Camillo there?

**CAMILLO**  
Ay, my good lord.

**LEONTES**  
Go play, Mamillius; thou'rt an honest man.

*Exit MAMILLIUS*

Camillo, this great sir will yet stay longer.

**CAMILLO**  
You had much ado to make his anchor hold:  
When you cast out, it still came home. /

**LEONTES**  
/ Didst note it?

**CAMILLO**  
He would not stay at your petitions: made  
His business more material. /

**LEONTES**  
/ Didst perceive it?

*\[Aside]*  
They're here with me already, whispering, rounding  
'Sicilia is a so-forth:' 'tis far gone,  
When I shall gust it last.' /

/ How came't, Camillo,  
That he did stay? /

**CAMILLO**  
/ At the good queen's entreaty.

**LEONTES**  
At the queen's be't: 'good' should be pertinent  
But, so it is, it is not. Was this taken  
By any understanding pate but thine?

**CAMILLO**  
Business, my lord! I think most understand  
Bohemia stays here longer. /

**LEONTES**  
/ Ay, but why?

**CAMILLO**  
To satisfy your highness and the entreaties  
Of our most gracious mistress. /

**LEONTES**  
/ Satisfy!  
The entreaties of your mistress! satisfy!  
Let that suffice. I have trusted thee, Camillo,  
With all the nearest things to my heart, as well  
My chamber-councils, wherein, priest-like, thou  
Hast cleansed my bosom, I from thee departed  
Thy penitent reform'd: but we have been  
Deceived in thy integrity, deceived  
In that which seems so. /

**CAMILLO**  
/ Be it forbid, my lord!

**LEONTES**  
To bide upon't, thou art not honest, or,  
If thou inclinest that way, thou art a coward,  
A servant grafted in my serious trust  
And therein negligent; or else a fool  
That seest a game play'd home, the rich stake drawn,  
And takest it all for jest. /

**CAMILLO**  
/ My gracious lord,  
I may be negligent, foolish and fearful;  
In every one of these no man is free,  
But that his negligence, his folly, fear,  
Among the infinite doings of the world,  
Sometime puts forth. But, beseech your grace,  
Be plainer with me; let me know my trespass.

**LEONTES**  
Ha' not you seen, Camillo,--for cogitation  
Resides not in that man that does not think,--  
My wife is slippery? If thou wilt confess,  
To have nor eyes nor ears nor thought, then say  
My wife's a hobby-horse, deserves a name  
As rank as any flax-wench that puts to  
Before her troth-plight: say't and justify't.

**CAMILLO**  
I would not be a stander-by to hear  
My sovereign mistress clouded so, without  
My present vengeance taken: 'shrew my heart,  
You never spoke what did become you less  
Than this; which to reiterate were sin  
As deep as that, though true. /

**LEONTES**  
/ Is whispering nothing?  
Is leaning cheek to cheek? is meeting noses?  
Skulking in corners? wishing clocks more swift?  
Hours, minutes? noon, midnight? and all eyes  
Blind with the pin and web but theirs, theirs only,  
That would unseen be wicked? is this nothing?  
Why, then the world and all that's in't is nothing;

**CAMILLO**  
Be cured of this diseased opinion, for  
Who can infect her?

**LEONTES**  
Why, he that wears her like a medal, hanging  
About his neck, Bohemia: who, if I  
Had servants true about me, they would do that  
Which should undo more doing: mightst bespice a cup,  
To give mine enemy a lasting wink;  
Which draught to me were cordial. /

**CAMILLO**  
/ Sir, my lord,  
I could do this, and that with no rash potion,  
But with a lingering dram that should not work  
Maliciously like poison: but I cannot  
Believe this crack to be in my dread mistress,  
So sovereignly being honourable.  
I've loved thee,-- /

**LEONTES**  
/ Make that thy question, and go rot!  
Dost think I am so muddy, so unsettled,  
Give scandal to the blood o' the prince my son,  
Who I do think is mine and love as mine,  
Without ripe moving to't? Would I do this?  
Could man so blench? /

**CAMILLO**  
/ I must believe you, sir:  
I do; and will fetch off Bohemia for't;  
Provided that, when he's removed, your highness  
Will take again your queen as yours at first,
Known and allied to yours. /

**LEONTES**  
/ Thou dost advise me  
Even so as I mine own course have set down:  
I'll give no blemish to her honor, none. /

**CAMILLO**  
/ My lord,  
Go then; and with a countenance as clear  
As friendship wears at feasts, keep with Bohemia  
And with your queen. I am his cupbearer:  
If from me he have wholesome beverage,  
Account me not your servant.

**LEONTES**  
I will seem friendly, as thou hast advised me.

*Exit*

**CAMILLO**  
O miserable lady! But, for me,  
What case stand I in? I must be the poisoner  
Of good Polixenes; and my ground to do't  
Is the obedience to a master, one  
Who in rebellion with himself will have  
All that are his so too. To do this deed,  
Promotion follows. If I could find example  
Of thousands that had struck anointed kings  
And flourish'd after, I'd not do't; I must  
Forsake the court: to do't, or no, is certain  
To me a break-neck. Happy star, reign now!  
Here comes Bohemia. /

*Re-enter POLIXENES*

**POLIXENES**  
/ Good day, Camillo.  
The king hath on him such a countenance  
As he had lost some province and a region  
Loved as he loves himself: even now I met him  
With customary compliment; when he,  
Wafting his eyes to the contrary and falling  
A lip of much contempt, speeds from me and  
So leaves me to consider what is breeding  
That changeth thus his manners. /

**CAMILLO**  
/ 'Tis a sickness  
Which puts some of us in distemper, but  
I cannot name the disease; and it is caught  
Of you that yet are well. /

**POLIXENES**  
/ How?! Caught of me?!  
I have look'd on thousands, who have sped the better  
By my regard, but kill'd none so. Camillo,--  
As you are certainly a gentleman, thereto-I beseech you,  
If you know aught which does behove my knowledge  
Thereof to be inform'd, imprison't not  
In ignorant concealment. /

**CAMILLO**  
/ Sir, I will tell you;  
Since I am charged in honour and by him  
That I think honourable: therefore mark my counsel,  
Which must be even as swiftly follow'd as  
I mean to utter it, or both yourself and me  
Cry lost, and so good night! /

**POLIXENES**  
/ On, good Camillo.

**CAMILLO**  
I am appointed him to murder you.

**POLIXENES**  
By whom, Camillo? /

**CAMILLO**  
/ By the king. /

**POLIXENES**  
/ For what?

**CAMILLO**  
He thinks, nay, with all confidence he swears,  
As he had seen't or been an instrument  
To vice you to't, that you have touch'd his queen  
Forbiddenly. /

**POLIXENES**  
/ O, then my best blood turn  
To an infected jelly and my name  
Be yoked with his that did betray the Best!

**CAMILLO**  
If therefore you dare trust my honesty,  
That lies enclosed in this trunk which you  
Shall bear along impawn'd, away tonight!  
Your followers I will whisper to the business,  
And will by twos and threes at several posterns  
Clear them o' the city. For myself, I'll put  
My fortunes to your service, which are here  
By this discovery lost. Be not uncertain;  
For, by the honor of my parents, I  
Have utter'd truth. /

**POLIXENES**  
/ I do believe thee:  
Be pilot to me and thy places shall  
Still neighbour mine. My ships are ready and  
My people did expect my hence departure  
Two days ago. This jealousy  
Is for a precious creature: Fear o'ershades me:  
Good expedition be my friend, and comfort  
The gracious queen, part of his theme, but nothing  
Of his ill-ta'en suspicion! Come, Camillo;  
I will respect thee as a father if  
Thou bear'st my life off hence: let us avoid.

*Exeunt*

## ACT II

### SCENE I. A room in LEONTES' palace.

*Enter LEONTES, HERMOINE, MAMILLIUS, ANTIGONUS, and a Lord*

**LEONTES**  
Was he met there? his train? Camillo with him?

**Lord**  
Behind the tuft of pines I met them; never  
Saw I men scour so on their way: I eyed them  
Even to their ships. /

**LEONTES**  
/ How blest am I  
In my just censure, in my true opinion!  
Camillo was his help in this, his pander:  
There is a plot against my life, my crown;  
How came the posterns so easily open?

**Lord**  
By his great authority; /

**LEONTES**  
/ I know't too well.  
Give me the boy: I am glad you did not nurse him:  
Though he does bear some signs of me, yet you  
Have too much blood in him. /

**HERMIONE**  
/ What is this? sport?

**LEONTES**  
Bear the boy hence; he shall not come about her;  
Away with him! and let her sport herself  
With that she's big with; for 'tis Polixenes  
Has made thee swell thus. /

**HERMIONE**  
/ But I'd say he had not,  
And I'll be sworn you would believe my saying,  
Howe'er you lean to the nayward. /

**LEONTES**  
/ You, my lords,  
Look on her, mark her well; be but about  
To say 'she is a goodly lady,' and  
The justice of your hearts will thereto add  
'Tis pity she's not honest, honorable:'  
She's an adulteress. /

**HERMIONE**  
/ Should a villain say so,  
The most replenish'd villain in the world,  
He were as much more villain: you, my lord,  
Do but mistake. /

**LEONTES**  
/ You have mistook, my lady,  
Polixenes for Leontes: O thou thing!  
She's an adulteress; I have said with whom:  
More, she's a traitor and Camillo is  
A federary with her, and one that knows  
What she should shame to know herself  
But with her most vile principal, that she's  
A bed-swerver, even as bad as those  
That vulgars give bold'st titles, ay, and privy  
To this their late escape. /

**HERMIONE**  
/ No, by my life.  
Privy to none of this. How will this grieve you,  
When you shall come to clearer knowledge, that  
You thus have publish'd me! Gentle my lord,  
You scarce can right me throughly then to say  
You did mistake. /

**LEONTES**  
/ Away with her! to prison!  
He who shall speak for her is afar off guilty  
But that he speaks. /

**HERMIONE**  
/ There's some ill planet reigns:  
I must be patient till the heavens look  
With an aspect more favourable. Good my lords,  
I am not prone to weeping, as our sex  
Commonly are; the want of which vain dew  
Perchance shall dry your pities: but I have  
That honorable grief lodged here which burns  
Worse than tears drown: beseech you all, my lords,  
With thoughts so qualified as your charities  
Shall best instruct you, measure me; and so  
The king's will be perform'd! /

**LEONTES**  
/ Shall I be heard?  
Go, do our bidding; hence!

*Exit HERMIONE*

**Lord**  
Beseech your highness, call the queen again.

**ANTIGONUS**  
Be certain what you do, sir, lest your justice  
Prove violence; in the which three great ones suffer,  
Yourself, your queen, your son. /

**Lord**  
/ For her, my lord,  
I dare my life lay down and will do't, sir,  
Please you to accept it, that the queen is spotless  
I' the eyes of heaven and to you; I mean,  
In this which you accuse her. /

**ANTIGONUS**  
/ If it prove  
She's otherwise, I'll keep my stables where  
I lodge my wife; I'll go in couples with her;  
Than when I feel and see her no farther trust her;  
For every inch of woman in the world,  
Ay, every dram of woman's flesh is false, If she be.

**LEONTES**  
Either thou art most ignorant by age,  
Or thou wert born a fool. Camillo's flight,  
Added to their familiarity,  
Made up to the deed, doth push on this proceeding:  
Yet, for a greater confirmation,  
For in an act of this importance 'twere  
Most piteous to be wild, I have dispatch'd in post  
To sacred Delphos: now from the oracle  
They will bring all; whose spiritual counsel had,  
Shall stop or spur me. Have I done well?

**Lord**  
Well done, my lord.

**LEONTES**  
Though I am satisfied and need no more  
Than what I know, yet shall the oracle  
Give rest to the minds of others, such as he  
Whose ignorant credulity will not  
Come up to the truth. So have we thought it good  
From our free person. Come, follow us;  
We are to speak in public; for this business  
Will raise us all. /

**ANTIGONUS**  
*\[Aside]*  
/ To laughter, as I take it,  
If the good truth were known.

*Exeunt*

### SCENE II. A prison.

*Enter PAULINA and the Jailor*

**PAULINA**  
You know me, do you not? /

**Jailor**  
/ For a worthy lady  
And one whom much I honor. /

**PAULINA**  
/ Pray you then,  
Conduct me to the queen. /

**Jailor**  
/ I may not, madam:  
To the contrary I have express commandment. /

**PAULINA**  
/ Here's ado,  
To lock up honesty and honor from  
The access of gentle visitors!  
Is't lawful, pray you, to see her women?  
any of them? Emilia? I pray now, call her.

**Jailor**  
I must be present at your conference.

**PAULINA**  
Well, be't so, prithee.

*Exit Jailor*

Here's such ado to make no stain a stain  
As passes coloring. /

*Re-enter Jailor, with EMILIA*

/ Dear gentlewoman,  
How fares our gracious lady?

**EMILIA**  
As well as one so great and so forlorn  
May hold together: on her frights and griefs,  
Which never tender lady hath born greater,  
She is something before her time deliver'd.

**PAULINA**  
A boy? /

**EMILIA**  
/ A daughter, and a goodly babe,  
Lusty and like to live: the queen receives  
Much comfort in't; says 'My poor prisoner,  
I am innocent as you.' /

**PAULINA**  
/ I dare be sworn  
These dangerous unsafe lunes i' the king, beshrew them!  
He must be told on't, and he shall: the office  
Becomes a woman best; I'll take't upon me:  
If I prove honey-mouth'd let my tongue blister  
And never to my red-look'd anger be  
The trumpet any more. Pray you, Emilia,  
Commend my best obedience to the queen:  
If she dares trust me with her little babe,  
I'll show't the king and undertake to be  
Her advocate to the loud'st. We do not know  
How he may soften at the sight o' the child:  
The silence often of pure innocence  
Persuades when speaking fails. /

**EMILIA**  
/ Most worthy madam,  
Your honor and your goodness is so evident  
That your free undertaking cannot miss  
A thriving issue: there is no lady living  
So meet for this great errand. Please your ladyship  
To visit the next room, I'll presently  
Acquaint the queen of your most noble offer;  
Who but today hammer'd of this design,  
But durst not tempt a minister of honor,  
Lest she should be denied. /

**PAULINA**  
/ Tell her, Emilia.

**EMILIA**  
I'll to the queen: please you, come something nearer.

**Jailor**  
Madam, if't please the queen to send the babe,  
I know not what I shall incur to pass it,  
Having no warrant. /

**PAULINA**  
/ You need not fear it, sir:  
This child was prisoner to the womb and is  
By law and process of great nature thence  
Freed and enfranchised, not a party to  
The anger of the king nor guilty of,  
If any be, the trespass of the queen.

**Jailor**  
I do believe it.

**PAULINA**  
Do not you fear: upon mine honor,  
I will stand betwixt you and danger.

*Exeunt*

### SCENE III. A room in LEONTES' palace.

*Enter LEONTES, ANTIGONUS, a Lord, and a Servant*

**LEONTES**  
Nor night nor day no rest: it is but weakness  
To bear the matter thus; mere weakness. If  
The cause were not in being,--part o' the cause,  
She the adulteress; for the harlot king  
Is quite beyond mine arm; but she  
I can hook to me: say that she were gone,  
Given to the fire, a moiety of my rest  
Might come to me again. Who's there? /

**First Servant**  
/ My lord?

**LEONTES**  
How does the boy? /

**Leontes' Servant**  
/ He took good rest tonight;  
'Tis hoped his sickness is discharged.

**LEONTES**  
To see his nobleness!  
Conceiving the dishonor of his mother,  
He straight declined, droop'd, took it deeply,  
Threw off his spirit, his appetite, his sleep,  
And downright languish'd. Leave me solely: go,  
See how he fares.

*Exit Servant*

The thought of my revenges that way  
Recoil upon me: in himself too mighty,  
And in his parties, his alliance; let him be  
Until a time may serve: for present vengeance,  
Take it on her. /

*Enter PAULINA, with a child*

**Lord**  
/ You must not enter.

**PAULINA**  
Nay, rather, good my lords, be second to me:  
Fear you his tyrannous passion more, alas,  
Than the queen's life? a gracious innocent soul,  
More free than he is jealous. /

**ANTIGONUS**  
/ That's enough.

**Lord**  
Madam, he hath not slept tonight; commanded  
None should come at him. /

**PAULINA**  
/ Not so hot, good sir:  
I come to bring him sleep. 'Tis such as you,  
That creep like shadows by him and do sigh  
At each his needless heavings, such as you  
Nourish the cause of his awaking: I  
Do come with words as medicinal as true,  
Honest as either, to purge him of that humor  
That presses him from sleep. /

**LEONTES**  
/ What noise there, ho?  
Away with that audacious lady! Antigonus,  
I charged thee that she should not come about me:  
I knew she would. What, canst not rule her?

**PAULINA**  
From all dishonesty he can: in this,  
Unless he take the course that you have done,  
Commit me for committing honor, trust it,  
He shall not rule me. Good my liege, I come;  
And, I beseech you, hear me, who profess  
Myself your loyal servant, your physician,  
Your most obedient counsellor, yet that dare  
Less appear so in comforting your evils,  
Than such as most seem yours: I say, I come  
From your good queen. /

**LEONTES**  
/ Good queen! /

**PAULINA**  
/ Good queen, my lord,  
Good queen; I say good queen;  
And would by combat make her good, so were I  
A man, the worst about you. /

**LEONTES**  
/ Force her hence.

**PAULINA**  
Let him that makes but trifles of his eyes  
First hand me: on mine own accord I'll off;  
But first I'll do my errand. The good queen,  
For she is good, hath brought you forth a daughter;  
Here 'tis; commends it to your blessing. /  
*\[Laying down the child]*

**LEONTES**  
/ Out!  
A mankind witch! Hence with her, out o' door:  
A most intelligencing bawd! /

**PAULINA**  
/ Not so:  
I am as ignorant in that as you  
In so entitling me, and no less honest  
Than you are mad; which is enough, I'll warrant,  
As this world goes, to pass for honest. /

**LEONTES**  
Will you not push her out? Give her the bastard.  
Take't up, I say; give't to thy crone. /

**PAULINA**  
/ Forever  
Unvenerable be thy hands, if thou  
Takest up the princess by that forced baseness  
Which he has put upon't! /

**LEONTES**  
/ He dreads his wife.

**PAULINA**  
So I would you did; then 'twere past all doubt  
You'd call your children yours. /

**LEONTES**  
/ A nest of traitors!

**PAULINA**  
Just one that's here, and that's himself, for he  
The sacred honor of himself, his queen's,  
His hopeful son's, his babe's, betrays to slander,  
Whose sting is sharper than the sword's.

**LEONTES**  
You'll not bait me! This brat is none of mine;  
It is the issue of Polixenes:  
Hence with it, and together with the dam  
Commit them to the fire! /

**PAULINA**  
/ It is yours;  
And, might we lay the old proverb to your charge,  
So like you, 'tis the worse. Behold, my lords,  
Although the print be little, the whole matter  
And copy of the father, eye, nose, lip,  
The pretty dimples of his chin and cheek,  
His smiles,  
And thou, good goddess Nature, which hast made it  
So like to him that got it, if thou hast  
The ordering of the mind too, 'mongst all colors  
No yellow in't, lest she suspect, as he does,  
Her children not her husband's! /

**LEONTES**  
/ A gross hag  
And, lozel, thou art worthy to be hang'd,  
That wilt not stay her tongue. Once more, take her hence.

**PAULINA**  
A most unworthy and unnatural lord  
Can do no more. /

**LEONTES**  
/ I'll ha' thee burnt. /

**PAULINA**  
/ I care not:  
It is an heretic that makes the fire,  
Not she which burns in't. I'll not call you tyrant;  
But this most cruel usage of your queen,  
Not able to produce more accusation  
Than your own weak-hinged fancy, something savors  
Of tyranny and will ignoble make you,  
Yea, scand'lous to the world. /

**LEONTES**  
/ On your allegiance,  
Out of the chamber with her! Were I a tyrant,  
Where were her life? She durst not call me so,  
If she did know me one. Away with her!

**PAULINA**  
I pray you, do not push me; I'll be gone.  
Look to your babe, my lord; 'tis yours:  
Jove send her  
A better guiding spirit! What needs these hands?  
You, that are thus so tender o'er his follies,  
Will never do him good, not one of you.  
So, so: farewell; we are gone.

*Exit*

**LEONTES**  
Thou, traitor, hast set on thy wife to this.  
My child? away with't! Even thou, that hast  
A heart so tender o'er it, take it hence  
And see it instantly consumed with fire;  
Within this hour bring me word 'tis done.
For thou set'st on thy wife. /

**ANTIGONUS**  
/ I did not, sir:  
This lord, my noble fellow, if he please,  
Can clear me in't. /

**LEONTES**  
/ You're liars all.

**Lord**  
We have always truly served you, and beseech you  
So to esteem of us, and on our knees we beg,  
As recompense of our dear services  
Past and to come, that you do change this purpose,  
Which being so horrible, so bloody, must  
Lead on to some foul issue: we all kneel.

**LEONTES**  
Shall I live on to see this bastard kneel  
And call me father? better burn it now  
Than curse it then. But be it; let it live.  
It shall not neither. You, sir, come you hither;  
Mark and perform me, see'st thou! for the fail  
Of any point in't shall not only be  
Death to thyself but to thy lewd-tongued wife,  
Whom for this time we pardon. We enjoin thee,  
As thou art liege-man to us, that thou carry  
This female bastard hence and that thou bear it  
To some remote and desert place quite out  
Of our dominions, and that there thou leave it,  
Without more mercy, to its own protection  
And favor of the climate. /

**ANTIGONUS**  
/ Come, poor babe:  
Some powerful spirit instruct the kites and ravens  
To be thy nurses! Wolves and bears, they say  
Casting their savageness aside have done  
Like offices of pity. /

*Exit with the child*

**LEONTES**  
/ No, I'll not rear  
Another's issue. /

*Enter the Servant*

**Leontes' Servant**  
/ Please your highness, posts  
From those you sent to the oracle are come  
An hour since: Cleomenes and Dion,  
Being well arrived from Delphos, are both landed,  
Hasting to the court. /

**LEONTES**  
/ Twenty-three days  
They have been absent: 'tis good speed; foretells  
The great Apollo suddenly will have  
The truth of this appear. Prepare you, lords;  
Summon a session, that we may arraign  
Our most disloyal lady, for, as she hath  
Been publicly accused, so shall she have  
A just and open trial. While she lives  
My heart will be a burthen to me. Leave me,  
And think upon my bidding.

*Exeunt*

## ACT III

### SCENE II. A court of Justice.

*Enter LEONTES, Lord, and Officer*

*Enter HERMIONE guarded; PAULINA and Ladies attending*

**LEONTES**  
Read the indictment. /

**Officer**  
*\[Reads]*  
/ Hermione, queen to the worthy  
Leontes, king of Sicilia, thou art here accused and  
arraigned of high treason, in committing adultery  
with Polixenes, king of Bohemia, and conspiring  
with Camillo to take away the life of our sovereign  
lord the king, thy royal husband: the pretence  
whereof being by circumstances partly laid open,  
thou, Hermione, contrary to the faith and allegiance  
of a true subject, didst counsel and aid them, for  
their better safety, to fly away by night.

**HERMIONE**  
Since what I am to say must be but that  
Which contradicts my accusation and  
The testimony on my part no other  
But what comes from myself, it shall scarce boot me  
To say 'not guilty:' mine integrity  
Being counted falsehood, shall, as I express it,  
Be so received. But thus: if powers divine  
Behold our human actions, as they do,  
I doubt not then but innocence shall make  
False accusation blush and tyranny  
Tremble at patience. You, my lord, best know,  
Who least will seem to do so, my past life  
Hath been as continent, as chaste, as true,  
As I am now unhappy; which is more  
Than history can pattern, though devised  
And play'd to take spectators. For behold me  
A fellow of the royal bed, which owe  
A moiety of the throne a great king's daughter,  
The mother to a hopeful prince, here standing  
To prate and talk for life and honor 'fore  
Who please to come and hear. For life, I prize it  
As I weigh grief, which I would spare: for honor,  
'Tis a derivative from me to mine,  
And only that I stand for. I appeal  
To your own conscience, sir, before Polixenes  
Came to your court, how I was in your grace,  
How merited to be so; since he came,  
With what encounter so uncurrent I  
Have strain'd to appear thus: if one jot beyond  
The bound of honor, or in act or will  
That way inclining, harden'd be the hearts  
Of all that hear me, and my near'st of kin  
Cry fie upon my grave! /

**LEONTES**  
/ I ne'er heard yet  
That any of these bolder vices wanted  
Less impudence to gainsay what they did  
Than to perform it first. /

**HERMIONE**  
/ That's true enough;  
Through 'tis a saying, sir, not due to me.

**LEONTES**  
You will not own it. /

**HERMIONE**  
/ More than mistress of  
Which comes to me in name of fault, I must not  
At all acknowledge. For Polixenes,  
With whom I am accused, I do confess  
I loved him as in honor he required,  
With such a kind of love as might become  
A lady like me, with a love even such,  
So and no other, as yourself commanded:  
Which not to have done I think had been in me  
Both disobedience and ingratitude  
To you and toward your friend, whose love had spoke,  
Even since it could speak, from an infant, freely  
That it was yours. Now, for conspiracy,  
I know not how it tastes; though it be dish'd  
For me to try how: all I know of it  
Is that Camillo was an honest man;  
And why he left your court, the gods themselves,  
Wotting no more than I, are ignorant.

**LEONTES**  
You knew of his departure, as you know  
What you have underta'en to do in's absence. /

**HERMIONE**  
/ Sir,  
You speak a language that I understand not:  
My life stands in the level of your dreams,  
Which I'll lay down. /

**LEONTES**  
/ Your actions are my dreams;  
You had a bastard by Polixenes,  
And I but dream'd it. As you were past all shame,–  
Those of your fact are so–so past all truth.  
They brat hat been cast out, like to itself,  
No father owning it,--which is, indeed,  
More criminal in thee than it,--so thou  
Shalt feel our justice, in whose easiest passage  
Look for no less than death. /

**HERMIONE**  
/ Sir, spare your threats:  
The bug which you would fright me with I seek.  
To me can life be no commodity:  
The crown and comfort of my life, your favor,  
I do give lost; for I do feel it gone,  
But know not how it went. My second joy  
And first-fruits of my body, from his presence  
I am barr'd, like one infectious. My third comfort  
Starr'd most unluckily, is from my breast,  
The innocent milk in its most innocent mouth,  
Haled out to murder: myself on every post  
Proclaimed a strumpet: with immodest hatred  
The child-bed privilege denied, which 'longs  
To women of all fashion; lastly, hurried  
Here to this place, i' the open air, before  
I have got strength of limit. Now, my liege,  
Tell me what blessings I have here alive,  
That I should fear to die? Therefore proceed.  
But yet hear this: mistake me not; no life,  
I prize it not a straw, but for mine honor,  
Which I would free, if I shall be condemn'd  
Upon surmises, all proofs sleeping else  
But what your jealousies awake, I tell you  
'Tis rigor and not law. Your honors all,  
I do refer me to the oracle:  
Apollo be my judge! /

**Lord**  
/ This your request  
Is altogether just: therefore bring forth,  
And in Apollos name, his oracle.

**LEONTES**  
Break up the seals and read. /

**Officer**  
*\[Reads]*  
/ Hermione is chaste;  
Polixenes blameless; Camillo a true subject; Leontes  
a jealous tyrant; his innocent babe truly begotten;  
and the king shall live without an heir, if that  
which is lost be not found.

**LEONTES**  
Hast thou read truth? /

**Officer**  
/ Ay, my lord; even so  
As it is here set down.

**LEONTES**  
There is no truth at all i' the oracle:  
The sessions shall proceed: this is mere falsehood.

*Enter Servant*

**Leontes' Servant**  
My lord the king, the king! /

**LEONTES**  
/ What is the business?

**Leontes' Servant**  
The prince your son, with mere conceit and fear  
Of the queen's speed, is gone. /

**LEONTES**  
/ How! gone! /

**Leontes' Servant**  
/ Is dead.

**LEONTES**  
Apollo's angry; and the heavens themselves  
Do strike at my injustice. /

*HERMIONE swoons*

/ How now there!

**PAULINA**  
This news is mortal to the queen: look down  
And see what death is doing. /

**LEONTES**  
/ Take her hence:  
Her heart is but o'ercharged; she will recover:  
I have too much believed mine own suspicion:  
Beseech you, tenderly apply to her  
Some remedies for life. /

*Exeunt PAULINA and Jailer, with HERMIONE*

/ Apollo, pardon  
My great profaneness 'gainst thine oracle!  
I'll reconcile me to Polixenes,  
New woo my queen, recall the good Camillo,  
Whom I proclaim a man of truth, of mercy;  
For, being transported by my jealousies  
To bloody thoughts and to revenge, I chose  
Camillo for the minister to poison  
My friend Polixenes: which had been done,  
But that the good mind of Camillo tardied  
My swift command, though I with death and with  
Reward did threaten and encourage him,  
Not doing 't and being done: how he glisters  
Thorough my rust! and how his pity  
Does my deeds make the blacker! /

*Re-enter PAULINA*

**PAULINA**  
/ Woe the while!  
What studied torments, tyrant, hast for me?  
What wheels? racks? fires? what flaying? boiling?  
In leads or oils? what old or newer torture  
Must I receive, whose every word deserves  
To taste of thy most worst? Thy tyranny  
Together working with thy jealousies,  
Fancies too weak for boys, too green and idle  
For girls of nine, O, think what they have done  
And then run mad indeed, stark mad! for all  
Thy bygone fooleries were but spices of it.  
That thou betray'dst Polixenes,'twas nothing;  
That did but show thee, of a fool, inconstant  
And damnable ingrateful: nor was't much,  
Thou wouldst have poison'd good Camillo's honor,  
To have him kill a king: poor trespasses,  
More monstrous standing by: whereof I reckon  
The casting forth to crows thy baby-daughter  
To be or none or little; though a devil  
Would have shed water out of fire ere done't:  
Nor is't directly laid to thee, the death  
Of the young prince, whose honorable thoughts,  
Thoughts high for one so tender, cleft the heart  
That could conceive a gross and foolish sire  
Blemish'd his gracious dam: this is not, no,  
Laid to thy answer: but the last,--O lords,  
When I have said, cry 'woe!' the queen, the queen,  
The sweet'st, dear'st creature's dead and vengeance for't  
Not dropp'd down yet. If word nor oath  
Prevail not, go and see: if you can bring  
Tincture or lustre in her lip, her eye,  
Heat outwardly or breath within, I'll serve you  
As I would do the gods. But, O thou tyrant!  
Do not repent these things, for they are heavier  
Than all thy woes can stir; therefore betake thee  
To nothing but despair. A thousand knees  
Ten thousand years together, naked, fasting,  
Upon a barren mountain and still winter  
In storm perpetual, could not move the gods  
To look that way thou wert. /

**LEONTES**  
/ Go on, go on  
Thou canst not speak too much; I deserve all.

**PAULINA**  
All faults I make, when I shall come to know them,  
I do repent. Alas! I have show'd too much  
The rashness of a woman: he is touch'd  
To the noble heart. What's gone and what's past help  
Should be past grief: do not receive affliction  
At my petition; I beseech you, rather  
Let me be punish'd, that have minded you  
Of what you should forget. Now, good my liege  
Sir, royal sir, forgive a foolish woman:  
The love I bore your queen--lo, fool again!--  
I'll speak of her no more, nor of your children;  
I'll not remember you of my own lord,  
Who is lost too: take your patience to you,  
And I'll say nothing. /

**LEONTES**  
/ Thou didst speak but well  
When most the truth; which I receive much better  
Than to be pitied of thee. Prithee, bring me  
To the dead bodies of my queen and son:  
One grave shall be for both. Once a day I'll visit  
The chapel where they lie, and tears shed there  
Shall be my recreation: Come and lead me  
Unto these sorrows.

*Exeunt*

### SCENE III. Bohemia. A desert country near the sea.

*Enter ANTIGONUS with a Child*

**ANTIGONUS**  
I have heard, but not believed, the spirits o' the dead  
May walk again: if such thing be, thy mother  
Appear'd to me last night, for ne'er was dream  
So like a waking. To me comes the creature,  
And gasping to begin some speech, her eyes  
Became two spouts: 'Good Antigonus,  
Since fate, against thy better disposition,  
Hath made thy person for the thrower-out  
Of my poor babe, according to thine oath,  
Places remote enough are in Bohemia,  
There weep and leave it crying; and, for the babe  
Is counted lost forever, Perdita,  
I prithee, call't. For this ungentle business  
Put on thee by my lord, thou ne'er shalt see  
Thy wife Paulina more.' And so, with shrieks  
She melted into air. Dreams are toys.  
There lie, and there thy character: there these;  
Which may, if fortune please, both breed thee, pretty,  
And still rest thine. The storm begins; poor wretch,  
That for thy mother's fault art thus exposed  
To loss and what may follow! Farewell!  
The day frowns more and more: thou'rt like to have  
A lullaby too rough: I never saw  
The heavens so dim by day. A savage clamor!  
Well may I get aboard! This is the chase:  
I am gone forever.

*Exit, pursued by a bear*

*Enter a Shepherd*

**Shepherd**  
I would there were no age between sixteen and  
three-and-twenty, or that youth would sleep out the  
rest; for there is nothing in the between but  
getting wenches with child, wronging the ancientry,  
stealing, fighting--Hark you now! Mercy on's, a barne a very  
pretty barne! A boy or a child, I wonder? A  
pretty one; a very pretty one: This has been  
some stair-work, some trunk-work, some  
behind-door-work: they were warmer that got this  
than the poor thing is here. I'll take it up for  
pity: yet I'll tarry till my son come; he hallooed  
but even now. Whoa, ho, hoa!

*Enter Clown*

**Clown**  
Hilloa, loa!

**Shepherd**  
What, art so near? If thou'lt see a thing to talk  
on when thou art dead and rotten, come hither. What  
ailest thou, man?

**Clown**  
I have seen two such sights, by sea and by land!  
but I am not to say it is a sea, for it is now the  
sky: betwixt the firmament and it, you cannot thrust  
a bodkin's point.

**Shepherd**  
Why, boy, how is it?

**Clown**  
I would you did but see how it chafes, how it rages,  
how it takes up the shore! but that's not the  
point. O, the most piteous cry of the poor souls!  
sometimes to see 'em, and not to see 'em; now the  
ship boring the moon with her main-mast, and anon  
swallowed with yest and froth, as you'd thrust a  
cork into a hogshead. And then for the  
land-service, to see how the bear tore out his  
shoulder-bone; how he cried to me for help and said  
his name was Antigonus, a nobleman. But to make an  
end of the ship, to see how the sea flap-dragoned  
it: but, first, how the poor souls roared, and the  
sea mocked them; and how the poor gentleman roared  
and the bear mocked him, both roaring louder than  
the sea or weather.

**Shepherd**  
Name of mercy, when was this, boy?

**Clown**  
Now, now: I have not winked since I saw these  
sights: the men are not yet cold under water, nor  
the bear half dined on the gentleman: he's at it  
now.

**Shepherd**  
Would I had been by, to have helped the old man!

**Clown**  
I would you had been by the ship side, to have  
helped her: there your charity would have lacked footing.

**Shepherd**  
Heavy matters! heavy matters! but look thee here,  
boy. Now bless thyself: thou mettest with things  
dying, I with things newborn. Here's a sight for  
thee; look thee, a bearing-cloth for a squire's  
child! look thee here; take up, take up, boy;  
open't. So, let's see: it was told me I should be  
rich by the fairies. This is some changeling:  
open't. What's within, boy?

**Clown**  
You're a made old man: if the sins of your youth  
are forgiven you, you're well to live. Gold! all gold!

**Shepherd**  
This is fairy gold, boy, and 'twill prove so: up  
with't, keep it close: home, home, the next way.  
We are lucky, boy; and to be so still requires  
nothing but secrecy. Let my sheep go: come, good  
boy, the next way home.

*Exeunt*

## INTERMISSION

## ACT IV

### SCENE I

*Enter Time, the Chorus*

**Time**  
I, that please some, try all, both joy and terror  
Of good and bad, that makes and unfolds error,  
Now take upon me, in the name of Time,  
To use my wings. Impute it not a crime  
To me or my swift passage, that I slide  
O'er sixteen years and leave the growth untried  
Of that wide gap, since it is in my power  
To o'erthrow law and in one self-born hour  
To plant and o'erwhelm custom. Let me pass  
The same I am, ere ancient'st order was  
Or what is now received: I witness to  
The times that brought them in; so shall I do  
To the freshest things now reigning and make stale  
The glistering of this present, as my tale  
Now seems to it. Your patience this allowing,  
I turn my glass and give my scene such growing  
As you had slept between: Leontes leaving,  
The effects of his fond jealousies so grieving  
That he shuts up himself, imagine me,  
Gentle spectators, that I now may be  
In fair Bohemia, and remember well,  
I mentioned a son o' the king's, which Florizel  
I now name to you; and with speed so pace  
To speak of Perdita, now grown in grace  
Equal with wondering: what of her ensues  
I list not prophecy; but let Time's news  
Be known when 'tis brought forth.  
A shepherd's daughter,  
And what to her adheres, which follows after,  
Is the argument of Time. Of this allow,  
If ever you have spent time worse ere now;  
If never, yet that Time himself doth say  
He wishes earnestly you never may.

*Exit*

### SCENE II. Bohemia. The palace of POLIXENES.

*Enter POLIXENES and CAMILLO*

**POLIXENES**  
I pray thee, good Camillo, be no more importunate:  
'tis a sickness denying thee any thing; a death to  
grant this.

**CAMILLO**  
It is fifteen years since I saw my country: though  
I have for the most part been aired abroad, I  
desire to lay my bones there. Besides, the penitent  
king, my master, hath sent for me.

**POLIXENES**  
As thou lovest me, Camillo, wipe not out the rest of  
thy services by leaving me now: the need I have of  
thee thine own goodness hath made. Say to me,  
when sawest thou the Prince Florizel, my son?

**CAMILLO**  
Sir, it is three days since I saw the prince. What  
his happier affairs may be, are to me unknown.

**POLIXENES**  
I have considered so much, Camillo, and with some  
care; that he is seldom from the house of a  
most homely shepherd; a man, they say, that from  
very nothing, and beyond the imagination of his  
neighbors, is grown into an unspeakable estate.

**CAMILLO**  
I have heard, sir, of such a man, who hath a  
daughter of most rare note.

**POLIXENES**  
That's likewise part of my intelligence; but, I  
fear, the angle that plucks our son thither. Thou  
shalt accompany us to the place; where we will, not  
appearing what we are, have some question with the  
shepherd; from whose simplicity I think it not  
uneasy to get the cause of my son's resort thither.

**CAMILLO**  
I willingly obey your command.

**POLIXENES**  
My best Camillo! We must disguise ourselves.

*Exeunt*

### SCENE III. A road near the Shepherd's cottage.

*Enter AUTOLYCUS*

**AUTOLYCUS**  
I have served Prince Florizel and in my time  
wore three-pile; but now I am out of service:  
My traffic is sheets; when the kite builds, look to  
lesser linen. My father named me Autolycus; who  
being, as I am, littered under Mercury, was likewise  
a snapper-up of unconsidered trifles. With die and  
drab I purchased this caparison, and my revenue is  
the silly cheat. Gallows and knock are too powerful  
on the highway: beating and hanging are terrors to  
me: for the life to come, I sleep out the thought  
of it. A prize! a prize!

*Enter Clown*

**Clown**  
Let me see: every 'leven wether tods; every tod  
yields pound and odd shilling; fifteen hundred  
shorn. what comes the wool to?

**AUTOLYCUS**  
*\[Aside]*  
If the springe hold, the cock's mine.

**Clown**  
I cannot do't without counters. Let me see; what am  
I to buy for our sheep-shearing feast? Three pound  
of sugar, five pound of currants, rice,--what will  
this sister of mine do with rice? But my father  
hath made her mistress of the feast, and she lays it  
on. I must have saffron to color the warden  
pies; mace; dates?-–none, that's out of my note;  
nutmegs, seven; a race or two of ginger, but that I  
may beg; four pound of prunes, and as many of  
raisins o' the sun.

**AUTOLYCUS**  
O that ever I was born!  
*\[Grovelling on the ground]*

**Clown**  
I' the name of me--

**AUTOLYCUS**  
O, help me, help me! pluck but off these rags; and  
then, death, death!

**Clown**  
Alack, poor soul! thou hast need of more rags to lay  
on thee, rather than have these off.

**AUTOLYCUS**  
O sir, the loathsomeness of them offends me more  
than the stripes I have received, which are mighty  
ones and millions.

**Clown**  
Alas, poor man! a million of beating may come to a  
great matter.

**AUTOLYCUS**  
I am robbed, sir, and beaten; my money and apparel  
ta'en from me, and these detestable things put upon  
me.

**Clown**  
What, by a horseman, or a footman?

**AUTOLYCUS**  
A footman, sweet sir, a footman.

**Clown**  
Lend me thy hand, I'll help thee: come, lend me thy hand.

**AUTOLYCUS**  
O, good sir, tenderly, O!

**Clown**  
How now! canst stand?

**AUTOLYCUS**  
*\[Picking his pocket]*  
Softly, dear sir; good sir, softly. You ha' done me  
a charitable office.

**Clown**  
Dost lack any money? I have a little money for thee.

**AUTOLYCUS**  
No, good sweet sir; no, I beseech you, sir: I have  
a kinsman not past three quarters of a mile hence,  
unto whom I was going; I shall there have money, or  
any thing I want: offer me no money, I pray you;  
that kills my heart.

**Clown**  
Shall I bring thee on the way?

**AUTOLYCUS**  
No, good-faced sir; no, sweet sir.

**Clown**  
Then fare thee well: I must go buy spices for our  
sheep-shearing.

**AUTOLYCUS**  
Prosper you, sweet sir!

*Exit Clown*

Your purse is not hot enough to purchase your spice.  
I'll be with you at your sheep-shearing too: if I  
make not this cheat bring out another and the  
shearers prove sheep, let me be unrolled and my name  
put in the book of virtue!

*Exit*

### SCENE IV. The Shepherd's cottage.

*Enter FLORIZEL and PERDITA*

**FLORIZEL**  
These your unusual weeds to each part of you  
Do give a life: no shepherdess, but Flora  
Peering in April's front. This your sheep-shearing  
Is as a meeting of the petty gods,  
And you the queen on't. /

**PERDITA**  
/ Sir, my gracious lord,  
To chide at your extremes it not becomes me:  
O, pardon, that I name them! Your high self,  
The gracious mark o' the land, you have obscured  
With a swain's wearing, and me, poor lowly maid,  
Most goddess-like prank'd up: but that our feasts  
In every mess have folly and the feeders  
Digest it with a custom, I should blush  
To see you so attired, sworn, I think,  
To show myself a glass. /

**FLORIZEL**  
/ I bless the time  
When my good falcon made her flight across  
Thy father's ground. /

**PERDITA**  
/ Now Jove afford you cause!  
To me the difference forges dread; your greatness  
Hath not been used to fear. Even now I tremble  
To think your father, by some accident,  
Should pass this way as you did: O, the Fates!  
How would he look, to see his work so noble  
Vilely bound up? What would he say? Or how  
Should I, in these my borrow'd flaunts, behold  
The sternness of his presence? /

**FLORIZEL**  
/ Apprehend  
Nothing but jollity. The gods themselves,  
Humbling their deities to love, have taken  
The shapes of beasts upon them: Jupiter  
Became a bull, and bellow'd; the green Neptune  
A ram, and bleated; and the fire-robed god,  
Golden Apollo, a poor humble swain,  
As I seem now. Their transformations  
Were never for a piece of beauty rarer,  
Nor in a way so chaste, since my desires  
Run not before mine honor, nor my lusts  
Burn hotter than my faith. /

**PERDITA**  
/ O, but, sir,  
Your resolution cannot hold, when 'tis  
Opposed, as it must be, by the power of the king.

**FLORIZEL**  
With these forced thoughts, I prithee, darken not  
The mirth o' the feast. Or I'll be thine, my fair,  
Or not my father's. For I cannot be  
Mine own, nor any thing to any, if  
I be not thine. To this I am most constant,  
Though destiny say no. Be merry, gentle;  
Strangle such thoughts as these with anything  
That you behold the while. Your guests are coming:  
Lift up your countenance, as it were the day  
Of celebration of that nuptial which  
We two have sworn shall come. /

**PERDITA**  
/ O lady Fortune,  
Stand you auspicious! /

**FLORIZEL**  
/ See, your guests approach:  
Address yourself to entertain them sprightly,  
And let's be red with mirth.

*Enter Shepherd, Clown, MOPSA and DORCAS, with POLIXENES and CAMILLO disguised*

**Shepherd**  
Fie, daughter! when my old wife lived, upon  
This day she was both pantler, butler, cook,  
Both dame and servant; welcomed all, served all.  
That which you are, mistress o' the feast: come on,  
And bid us welcome to your sheep-shearing,  
As your good flock shall prosper. /

**PERDITA**  
*\[To POLIXENES]*  
/ Sir, welcome:  
It is my father's will I should take on me  
The hostess-ship o' the day. /

*\[To CAMILLO]*  
/ You're welcome, sir.  
Give me those flowers there, Dorcas. Reverend sirs,  
For you there's rosemary and rue; these keep  
Seeming and savor all the winter long:  
Grace and remembrance be to you both,  
And welcome to our shearing! /

**POLIXENES**  
/ Shepherdess,  
A fair one are you--well you fit our ages  
With flowers of winter. /

**PERDITA**  
/ Sir, the year growing ancient,  
Not yet on summer's death, nor on the birth  
Of trembling winter, the fairest flowers o' the season  
Are our carnations and streak'd gillyvors,  
Which some call nature's bastards: of that kind  
Our rustic garden's barren; and I care not  
To get slips of them. /

**POLIXENES**  
/ Wherefore, gentle maiden,  
Do you neglect them? /

**PERDITA**  
/ For I have heard it said  
There is an art which in their piedness shares  
With great creating nature. /

**POLIXENES**  
/ Say there be;  
Yet nature is made better by no mean  
But nature makes that mean: so, over that art  
Which you say adds to nature, is an art  
That nature makes. You see, sweet maid, we marry  
A gentler scion to the wildest stock,  
And make conceive a bark of baser kind  
By bud of nobler race: this is an art  
Which does mend nature, change it rather, but  
The art itself is nature. /

**PERDITA**  
/ So it is.

**POLIXENES**  
Then make your garden rich in gillyvors,  
And do not call them bastards. /

**PERDITA**  
/ I'll not put  
The dibble in earth to set one slip of them;  
No more than were I painted I would wish  
This youth should say 'twere well and only therefore  
Desire to breed by me. /

*\[To CAMILLO]*  
/ Here's flowers for you.  
Methinks I play as I have seen them do  
In Whitsun pastorals: sure this robe of mine  
Does change my disposition. /

**FLORIZEL**  
/ What you do  
Still betters what is done. When you speak, sweet.  
I'd have you do it ever: when you sing,  
I'd have you buy and sell so, so give alms,  
Pray so; and, for the ordering your affairs,  
To sing them too: when you do dance, I wish you  
A wave o' the sea, that you might ever do  
Nothing but that; move still, still so,  
And own no other function: each your doing,  
So singular in each particular,  
Crowns what you are doing in the present deed,  
That all your acts are queens. /

**PERDITA**  
/ O Doricles,  
Your praises are too large: but that your youth,  
And the true blood which peepeth fairly through't,  
Do plainly give you out an unstain'd shepherd,  
With wisdom I might fear, my Doricles,  
You woo'd me the false way. /

**FLORIZEL**  
/ I think you have  
As little skill to fear as I have purpose  
To put you to't. But come; our dance, I pray:  
Your hand, my Perdita: so turtles pair,  
That never mean to part. /

**PERDITA**  
/ I'll swear for 'em.

**POLIXENES**  
This is the prettiest low-born lass that ever  
Ran on the green-sward: nothing she does or seems  
But smacks of something greater than herself,  
Too noble for this place. /

**Clown**  
/ Come on, strike up!

*Music. Here a dance of Shepherds and Shepherdesses*

**POLIXENES**  
Pray, good shepherd, what fair swain is this  
Which dances with your daughter?

**Shepherd**  
They call him Doricles; and boasts himself  
To have a worthy feeding: but I have it  
Upon his own report and I believe it;  
He looks like sooth. He says he loves my daughter:  
I think so too; for never gazed the moon  
Upon the water as he'll stand and read  
As 'twere my daughter's eyes; and, to be plain.  
I think there is not half a kiss to choose  
Who loves another best. /

**POLIXENES**  
/ She dances featly.

*Enter Servant*

**Shepherd's Servant**  
O master, if you did but hear the pedlar at the  
door, you would never dance again after a tabour and  
pipe; no, the bagpipe could not move you: he sings  
several tunes faster than you'll tell money; he  
utters them as he had eaten ballads and all men's  
ears grew to his tunes.

**Clown**  
Prithee bring him in; and let him approach singing.

**PERDITA**  
Forewarn him that he use no scurrilous words in 's tunes.

*Exit Servant*

**Clown**  
You have of these pedlars, that have more in them  
than you'd think, sister.

**PERDITA**  
Ay, good brother, or go about to think.

*Enter AUTOLYCUS, singing*

**AUTOLYCUS**  
Lawn as white as driven snow;  
Cyprus black as e'er was crow;  
Gloves as sweet as damask roses;  
Masks for faces and for noses;  
Bugle bracelet, necklace amber,  
Perfume for a lady's chamber;  
Golden quoifs and stomachers,  
For my lads to give their dears:  
Pins and poking-sticks of steel,  
What maids lack from head to heel:  
Come buy of me, come; come buy, come buy;  
Buy lads, or else your lasses cry: Come buy.

*Exit AUTOLYCUS*

**POLIXENES**  
*\[To CAMILLO]*  
Is it not too far gone? 'Tis time to part them.  
He's simple and tells much. /

*\[To FLORIZEL]*  
/ How now, fair shepherd!  
Your heart is full of something that does take  
Your mind from feasting. Sooth, when I was young  
And handed love as you do, I was wont  
To load my she with knacks: I would have ransack'd  
The pedlar's silken treasury and have pour'd it  
To her acceptance; you have let him go  
And nothing marted with him. If your lass  
Interpretation should abuse and call this  
Your lack of love or bounty, you were straited  
For a reply, at least if you make a care  
Of happy holding her. /

**FLORIZEL**  
/ Old sir, I know  
She prizes not such trifles as these are:  
The gifts she looks from me are pack'd and lock'd  
Up in my heart; which I have given already,  
But not deliver'd. O, hear me breathe my life  
Before this ancient sir, who, it should seem,  
Hath sometime loved! I take thy hand, this hand,  
As soft as dove's down and as white as it,  
Or Ethiopian's tooth, or the fann'd snow that's bolted  
By the northern blasts twice o'er. /

**POLIXENES**  
/ What follows this?  
How prettily the young swain seems to wash  
The hand was fair before! I have put you out:  
But to your protestation; let me hear  
What you profess. /

**FLORIZEL**  
/ Do, and be witness to 't.

**POLIXENES**  
And this my neighbour too? /

**FLORIZEL**  
/ And he, and more  
Than he, and men, the earth, the heavens, and all:  
That, were I crown'd the most imperial monarch,  
Thereof most worthy, were I the fairest youth  
That ever made eye swerve, had force and knowledge  
More than was ever man's, I would not prize them  
Without her love; for her employ them all;  
Commend them and condemn them to her service  
Or to their own perdition. /

**POLIXENES**  
/ Fairly offer'd.

**CAMILLO**  
This shows a sound affection. /

**Shepherd**  
/ But, my daughter,  
Say you the like to him? /

**PERDITA**  
/ I cannot speak  
So well, nothing so well; no, nor mean better:  
By the pattern of mine own thoughts I cut out  
The purity of his. /

**Shepherd**  
/ Take hands, a bargain!  
I give my daughter to him, and will make  
Her portion equal his. /

**FLORIZEL**  
/ O, that must be  
I' the virtue of your daughter: one being dead,  
I shall have more than you can dream of yet;  
Enough then for your wonder. But, come on,  
Contract us 'fore these witnesses. /

**Shepherd**  
/ Come, your hand;  
And, daughter, yours. /

**POLIXENES**  
/ Soft, swain, awhile, beseech you;  
Have you a father? /

**FLORIZEL**  
/ I have: but what of him?

**POLIXENES**  
Knows he of this? /

**FLORIZEL**  
/ He neither does nor shall.

**POLIXENES**  
Methinks a father  
Is at the nuptial of his son a guest  
That best becomes the table. Pray you once more,  
Is not your father grown incapable  
Of reasonable affairs? /

**FLORIZEL**  
/ No, good sir;  
He has his health and ampler strength indeed  
Than most have of his age. /

**POLIXENES**  
/ By my white beard,  
You offer him, if this be so, a wrong  
Something unfilial: reason my son  
Should choose himself a wife, but as good reason  
The father, all whose joy is nothing else  
But fair posterity, should hold some counsel  
In such a business. /

**FLORIZEL**  
/ I yield all this;  
But for some other reasons, my grave sir,  
Which 'tis not fit you know, I not acquaint  
My father of this business. /

**POLIXENES**  
/ Let him know't.

**FLORIZEL**  
He shall not. /

**POLIXENES**  
/ Prithee, let him. /

**FLORIZEL**  
/ No, he must not.

**Shepherd**  
Let him, my son: he shall not need to grieve  
At knowing of thy choice. /

**FLORIZEL**  
/ Come, come, he must not.  
Mark our contract. /

**POLIXENES**  
/ Mark your divorce, young sir,

*\[Discovering himself]*  
Whom son I dare not call; thou art too base  
To be acknowledged: thou a sceptre's heir,  
That thus affect'st a sheep-hook! Thou old traitor,  
I am sorry that by hanging thee I can  
But shorten thy life one week. /

**Shepherd**  
/ O, my heart!

**POLIXENES**  
I'll have thy beauty scratch'd with briers, and made  
More homely than thy state. For thee, fond boy,  
If I may ever know thou dost but sigh  
That thou no more shalt see this knack, as never  
I mean thou shalt, we'll bar thee from succession;  
Follow us to the court. Thou churl, for this time,  
Though full of our displeasure, yet we free thee  
From the dead blow of it. And you, enchantment,  
Unworthy thee–if ever henceforth thou  
These rural latches to his entrance open,  
Or hoop his body more with thy embraces,  
I will devise a death as cruel for thee  
As thou art tender to't. /

*Exit*

**PERDITA**  
/ Even here undone!  
I was not much afeard; for once or twice  
I was about to speak and tell him plainly,  
The selfsame sun that shines upon his court  
Hides not his visage from our cottage but  
Looks on alike. Will't please you, sir, be gone?  
I told you what would come of this: beseech you,  
Of your own state take care: this dream of mine,--  
Being now awake, I'll queen it no inch farther,  
But milk my ewes and weep. /

**Shepherd**  
/ I cannot speak, nor think  
Nor dare to know that which I know. O sir!  
You have undone a man of fourscore three,  
That thought to fill his grave in quiet, yea,  
To die upon the bed my father died,  
To lie close by his honest bones: but now  
Some hangman must put on my shroud and lay me  
Where no priest shovels in dust. O cursed wretch,  
That knew'st this was the prince, and wouldst adventure  
To mingle faith with him! Undone! undone!  
If I might die within this hour, I have lived  
To die when I desire. /

*Exit*

**FLORIZEL**  
/ Why look you so upon me?  
I am but sorry, not afeard; delay'd,  
But nothing alter'd: what I was, I am;  
More straining on for plucking back, not following  
My leash unwillingly.

**CAMILLO**  
Gracious my lord,  
You know your father's temper: at this time  
He will allow no speech, which I do guess  
You do not purpose to him; and as hardly  
Will he endure your sight as yet, I fear:  
Then, till the fury of his highness settle,  
Come not before him. /

**FLORIZEL**  
/ I not purpose it.  
I think, Camillo? /

**CAMILLO**  
/ Even he, my lord.

**PERDITA**  
How often have I told you 'twould be thus!  
How often said, my dignity would last  
But till 'twere known! /

**FLORIZEL**  
/ It cannot fail but by  
The violation of my faith; and then  
Let nature crush the sides o' the earth together  
And mar the seeds within! Lift up thy looks:  
From my succession wipe me, father; I  
Am heir to my affection. /

**CAMILLO**  
/ 'Tis desperate, sir.

**FLORIZEL**  
So call it: but it does fulfil my vow;  
I needs must think it honesty: therefore, I pray you,  
As you have ever been my father's honor'd friend,  
When he shall miss me, cast your good counsels  
Upon his passion; let myself and fortune  
Tug for the time to come. This you may know  
And so deliver, I am put to sea  
With her whom here I cannot hold on shore;  
And most opportune to our need I have  
A vessel rides fast by, but not prepared  
For this design. What course I mean to hold  
Shall nothing benefit your knowledge, nor  
Concern me the reporting. Hark, Perdita

*\[Drawing her aside]*  
I'll hear you by and by. /

**CAMILLO**  
/ He's irremoveable,  
Resolved for flight. Now were I happy, if  
His going I could frame to serve my turn,  
Save him from danger, do him love and honor,  
Purchase the sight again of dear Sicilia  
And that unhappy king, my master, whom  
I so much thirst to see. /

**FLORIZEL**  
/ Now, good Camillo;  
I am so fraught with curious business that  
I leave out ceremony. /

**CAMILLO**  
/ Sir, I think  
You have heard of my poor services, i' the love  
That I have borne your father? Well, my lord,  
If you may please to think I love the king  
And through him what is nearest to him, which is  
Your gracious self, embrace but my direction:  
I'll point you where you shall have such receiving  
As shall become your highness; where you may  
Enjoy your mistress, from the whom, I see,  
There's no disjunction to be made, but by--  
As heavens forefend!--your ruin; marry her,  
And, with my best endeavours in your absence,  
Your discontenting father strive to qualify  
And bring him up to liking. /

**FLORIZEL**  
/ How, Camillo,  
May this, almost a miracle, be done?  
That I may call thee something more than man  
And after that trust to thee. /

**CAMILLO**  
/ Have you thought on  
A place whereto you'll go? /

**FLORIZEL**  
/ Not any yet.

**CAMILLO**  
This follows, if you will not change your purpose  
But undergo this flight, make for Sicilia,  
And there present yourself and your fair princess,  
For so I see she must be, 'fore Leontes:  
She shall be habited as it becomes  
The partner of your bed: asks thee the son forgiveness,  
As 'twere i' the father's person; kisses the hands  
Of your fresh princess; o'er and o'er divides him  
'Twixt his unkindness and his kindness; the one  
He chides to hell and bids the other grow  
Faster than thought or time. /

**FLORIZEL**  
/ Worthy Camillo,  
What color for my visitation shall I  
Hold up before him? /

**CAMILLO**  
/ Sent by the king your father  
To greet him and to give him comforts, sir.

**FLORIZEL**  
There is some sap in this. /

**CAMILLO**  
/ A cause more promising  
Than a wild dedication of yourselves  
To unpath'd waters, undream'd shores, most certain  
To miseries enough; no hope to help you,  
But as you shake off one to take another;  
Nothing so certain as your anchors, who  
Do their best office, if they can but stay you  
Where you'll be loath to be: besides you know  
Prosperity's the very bond of love,  
Whose fresh complexion and whose heart together  
Affliction alters. /

**PERDITA**  
/ One of these is true:  
I think affliction may subdue the cheek,  
But not take in the mind. /

**CAMILLO**  
/ Yea, say you so?  
There shall not at your father's house these seven years  
Be born another such. /

**FLORIZEL**  
/ My prettiest Perdita!  
But O, the thorns we stand upon! Camillo,  
Preserver of my father, now of me,  
The medicine of our house, how shall we do?  
We are not furnish'd like Bohemia's son,  
Nor shall appear in Sicilia. /

**CAMILLO**  
/ My lord,
Fear none of this: I think you know my fortunes  
Do all lie there: it shall be so my care  
To have you royally appointed as if  
The scene you play were mine. For instance, sir,  
That you may know you shall not want, one word.

*They talk aside*

*Re-enter AUTOLYCUS*

**AUTOLYCUS**  
Ha, ha! What a fool Honesty is! And Trust, his  
sworn brother, a very simple gentleman! I have sold  
all my trumpery, not a counterfeit stone, not a  
ribbon, glass, pomander, brooch, table-book, ballad,  
knife, tape, glove, shoe-tie, bracelet, horn-ring,  
to keep my pack from fasting!

**CAMILLO**  
Nay, but my letters, by this means being there  
So soon as you arrive, shall clear that doubt.

**FLORIZEL**  
And those that you'll procure from King Leontes--

**CAMILLO**  
Shall satisfy your father. /

**PERDITA**  
/ Happy be you!  
All that you speak shows fair. /

**CAMILLO**  
/ Who have we here?

*\[Seeing AUTOLYCUS]*  
We'll make an instrument of this, omit  
Nothing may give us aid.

*\[To AUTOLYCUS]*  
How now, good fellow! why shakest thou so? Fear  
not, man; here's no harm intended to thee.

**AUTOLYCUS**  
I am a poor fellow, sir.

**CAMILLO**  
Why, be so still; here's nobody will steal that from  
thee: yet for the outside of thy poverty we must  
make an exchange; therefore discase thee instantly,  
--thou must think there's a necessity in't,--and  
change garments with this gentleman: though the  
pennyworth on his side be the worst, yet hold thee,  
there's some boot.

**AUTOLYCUS**  
I am a poor fellow, sir.

*\[Aside]*
I know ye well enough.

**CAMILLO**  
Nay, prithee, dispatch: the gentleman is half  
flayed already.

**AUTOLYCUS**  
Are you in earnest, sir?

*\[Aside]*
I smell the trick on't.

**FLORIZEL**  
Dispatch, I prithee.

**AUTOLYCUS**  
Indeed, I have had earnest: but I cannot with  
conscience take it.

**CAMILLO**  
Unbuckle, unbuckle.

*FLORIZEL and AUTOLYCUS exchange garments*

Fortunate mistress,--let my prophecy  
Come home to ye!--you must retire yourself  
Into some covert: take your sweetheart's hat  
And pluck it o'er your brows, muffle your face,  
Dismantle you, and, as you can, disliken  
The truth of your own seeming; that you may--  
For I do fear eyes over--to shipboard  
Get undescried. /

**PERDITA**  
/ I see the play so lies  
That I must bear a part. /

**CAMILLO**  
/ No remedy.
Have you done there? /

**FLORIZEL**  
/ Should I now meet my father,  
He would not call me son. /

**CAMILLO**  
*\[Giving it to PERDITA]*  
/ Nay, you shall have no hat.
Come, lady, come. Farewell, my friend. /

**AUTOLYCUS**  
/ Adieu, sir.

**FLORIZEL**  
O Perdita, what have we twain forgot!  
Pray you, a word.

**CAMILLO**  
*\[Aside]*
What I do next, shall be to tell the king  
Of this escape and whither they are bound;  
Wherein my hope is I shall so prevail  
To force him after: in whose company  
I shall review Sicilia, for whose sight  
I have a woman's longing. /

**FLORIZEL**  
/ Fortune speed us!  
Thus we set on, Camillo, to the sea-side.

**CAMILLO**  
The swifter speed the better.

*Exeunt FLORIZEL, PERDITA, and CAMILLO*

**AUTOLYCUS**  
I understand the business, I hear it: to have an  
open ear, a quick eye, and a nimble hand, is  
necessary for a cut-purse; a good nose is requisite  
also, to smell out work for the other senses. I see  
this is the time that the unjust man doth thrive.  
What an exchange had this been without boot! What  
a boot is here with this exchange! Sure the gods do  
this year connive at us, and we may do any thing  
extempore. The prince himself is about a piece of  
iniquity, stealing away from his father with his  
clog at his heels: if I thought it were a piece of  
honesty to acquaint the king withal, I would not  
do't: I hold it the more knavery to conceal it;  
and therein am I constant to my profession.

*Re-enter Clown and Shepherd*

Aside, aside; here is more matter for a hot brain:  
every lane's end, every shop, church, session,  
hanging, yields a careful man work.

**Clown**  
See, see; what a man you are now!  
There is no other way but to tell the king  
she's a changeling and none of your flesh and blood.

**Shepherd**  
Nay, but hear me.

**Clown**  
Nay, but hear me.

**Shepherd**  
Go to, then.

**Clown**  
She being none of your flesh and blood, your flesh  
and blood has not offended the king; and so your  
flesh and blood is not to be punished by him. Show  
those things you found about her, those secret  
things, all but what she has with her: this being  
done, let the law go whistle: I warrant you.

**AUTOLYCUS**  
*\[Aside]*
Very wisely, puppies!

**Shepherd**  
Well, let us to the king: there is that in this  
fardel will make him scratch his beard.

**AUTOLYCUS**  
*\[Aside]*
I know not what impediment this complaint  
may be to the flight of my master.

**Clown**  
Pray heartily he be at palace.

**Shepherd**  
To the palace, an it like your worship.

**AUTOLYCUS**  
Your affairs there, what, with whom, the condition  
of that fardel, the place of your dwelling, your  
names, your ages, of what having, breeding, and any  
thing that is fitting to be known, discover.

**Clown**  
We are but plain fellows, sir.

**AUTOLYCUS**  
A lie; you are rough and hairy. Let me have no  
lying: it becomes none but tradesmen, and they  
often give us soldiers the lie: but we pay them for  
it with stamped coin, not stabbing steel; therefore  
they do not give us the lie.

**Clown**  
Your worship had like to have given us one, if you  
had not taken yourself with the manner.

**Shepherd**  
Are you a courtier, an't like you, sir?

**AUTOLYCUS**  
Whether it like me or no, I am a courtier. Seest  
thou not the air of the court in these enfoldings?  
hath not my gait in it the measure of the court?  
receives not thy nose court-odor from me? reflect I  
not on thy baseness court-contempt? Thinkest thou,  
for that I insinuate, or toaze from thee thy  
business, I am therefore no courtier? I am courtier  
cap-a-pe; and one that will either push on or pluck  
back thy business there: whereupon I command thee to  
open thy affair.

**Shepherd**  
My business, sir, is to the king.

**AUTOLYCUS**  
How blessed are we that are not simple men!  
Yet nature might have made me as these are,  
Therefore I will not disdain.

**Clown**  
This cannot be but a great courtier.

**Shepherd**  
His garments are rich, but he wears  
them not handsomely.

**AUTOLYCUS**  
The fardel there? what's i' the fardel?  
Wherefore that box?

**Shepherd**  
Sir, there lies such secrets in this fardel and box,  
which none must know but the king; and which he  
shall know within this hour, if I may come to the  
speech of him.

**AUTOLYCUS**  
The king is not at the palace; he is gone aboard a  
new ship to purge melancholy and air himself: for,  
if thou beest capable of things serious, thou must  
know the king is full of grief.

**Clown**  
Think you so, sir?

**AUTOLYCUS**  
Not he alone shall suffer what wit can make heavy  
and vengeance bitter; but those that are germane to  
him, though removed fifty times, shall all come  
under the hangman: which though it be great pity,  
yet it is necessary. An old sheep-whistling rogue a  
ram-tender, to offer to have his daughter come into  
grace! Some say he shall be stoned; but that death  
is too soft for him, say I draw our throne into a  
sheep-cote! all deaths are too few, the sharpest too easy.

**Clown**  
Has the old man e'er a son, sir, do you hear. an't  
like you, sir?

**AUTOLYCUS**  
He has a son, who shall be flayed alive; then  
'nointed over with honey, set on the head of a  
wasp's nest; then stand till he be three quarters  
and a dram dead; then recovered again with  
aqua-vitae or some other hot infusion; then, raw as  
he is, and in the hottest day prognostication  
proclaims, shall be be set against a brick-wall, the  
sun looking with a southward eye upon him, where he  
is to behold him with flies blown to death. But what  
talk we of these traitorly rascals, whose miseries  
are to be smiled at, their offences being so  
capital? Tell me, for you seem to be honest plain  
men, what you have to the king: being something  
gently considered, I'll bring you where he is  
aboard, tender your persons to his presence,  
whisper him in your behalfs; and if it be in man  
besides the king to effect your suits, here is man  
shall do it.

**Clown**  
He seems to be of great authority: close with him,  
give him gold; and though authority be a stubborn  
bear, yet he is oft led by the nose with gold: show  
the inside of your purse to the outside of his hand,  
and no more ado. Remember 'stoned,' and 'flayed alive.'

**Shepherd**  
An't please you, sir, to undertake the business for  
us, here is that gold I have: I'll make it as much  
more and leave this young man in pawn till I bring it you.

**AUTOLYCUS**  
After I have done what I promised?

**Shepherd**  
Ay, sir.

**AUTOLYCUS**  
Well, give me the moiety. Are you a party in this business?

**Clown**  
In some sort, sir: but though my case be a pitiful  
one, I hope I shall not be flayed out of it.

**AUTOLYCUS**  
O, that's the case of the shepherd's son: hang him,  
he'll be made an example.

**Clown**  
Comfort, good comfort! We must to the king and show  
our strange sights: he must know 'tis none of your  
daughter nor my sister; we are gone else. Sir, I  
will give you as much as this old man does when the  
business is performed, and remain, as he says, your  
pawn till it be brought you.

**AUTOLYCUS**  
I will trust you. Walk before toward the sea-side;  
go on the right hand: I will but look upon the  
hedge and follow you.

**Clown**  
We are blest in this man, as I may say, even blest.

**Shepherd**  
Let's before as he bids us: he was provided to do us good.

*Exeunt Shepherd and Clown*

**AUTOLYCUS**  
If I had a mind to be honest, I see Fortune would  
not suffer me: she drops booties in my mouth. I am  
courted now with a double occasion, gold and a means  
to do the prince my master good; which who knows how  
that may turn back to my advancement? I will bring  
these two moles, these blind ones, aboard him: if he  
think it fit to shore them again and that the  
complaint they have to the king concerns him  
nothing, let him call me rogue for being so far  
officious; for I am proof against that title and  
what shame else belongs to't. To him will I present  
them: there may be matter in it.

*Exit*

## ACT V

### SCENE I. A room in LEONTES' palace.

*Enter LEONTES and PAULINA*

**PAULINA**  
If, one by one, you wedded all the world,  
Or from the all that are took something good,  
To make a perfect woman, she you kill'd  
Would be unparallel'd. /

**LEONTES**  
/ I think so. Kill'd!  
She I kill'd! I did so: but thou strikest me  
Sorely, to say I did; it is as bitter  
Upon thy tongue as in my thought: now, good now,  
Say so but seldom. My good Paulina,  
Who hast the memory of Hermione,  
I know, in honor, O, that ever I  
Had squared me to thy counsel! then, even now,  
I might have look'd upon my queen's full eyes,  
Have taken treasure from her lips-- /

**PAULINA**  
/ And left them
More rich for what they yielded. /

**LEONTES**  
/ Thou speak'st truth.  
No more such wives; therefore, no wife: one worse,  
And better used, would make her sainted spirit  
Again possess her corpse, and on this stage,  
Where we're offenders now, appear soul-vex'd,  
And begin, 'Why to me?' /

**PAULINA**  
/ Had she such power,  
She had just cause. /

**LEONTES**  
/ She had; and would incense me  
To murder her I married. /

**PAULINA**  
/ I should so.
Were I the ghost that walk'd, I'd bid you mark  
Her eye, and tell me for what dull part in't  
You chose her; then I'd shriek, that even your ears  
Should rift to hear me; and the words that follow'd  
Should be 'Remember mine.' /

**LEONTES**  
/ Stars, stars,
And all eyes else dead coals! Fear thou no wife;  
I'll have no wife, Paulina. /

**PAULINA**  
/ Will you swear
Never to marry but by my free leave?

**LEONTES**  
Never, Paulina; so be blest my spirit!

**PAULINA**  
Then, good my lord, bear witness to his oath:  
Unless another, as like Hermione affront his eye.  
Yet, if my lord will marry,--if you will, sir,  
No remedy, but you will,--give me the office  
To choose you a queen: she shall not be so young  
As was your former; but she shall be such  
As, walk'd your first queen's ghost, it should take joy  
To see her in your arms. /

**LEONTES**  
/ My true Paulina,
We shall not marry till thou bid'st us. /

**PAULINA**  
/ That
Shall be when your first queen's again in breath;  
Never till then.

*Enter a Gentleman*

**Gentleman**  
One that gives out himself Prince Florizel,  
Son of Polixenes, with his princess, she  
The fairest I have yet beheld, desires access  
To your high presence. /

**LEONTES**  
/ What with him? he comes not  
Like to his father's greatness: his approach,  
So out of circumstance and sudden, tells us  
'Tis not a visitation framed, but forced  
By need and accident. /

**PAULINA**  
/ O Hermione,
As every present time doth boast itself  
Above a better gone, so must thy grave  
Give way to what's seen now! Sir, you yourself  
Have said and writ so, but your writing now  
Is colder than that theme, 'She had not been,  
Nor was not to be equall'd;'--thus your verse  
Flow'd with her beauty once: 'tis shrewdly ebb'd,  
To say you have seen a better. /

**Gentleman**  
/ Pardon, madam:
The one I have almost forgot,--your pardon,--  
The other, when she has obtain'd your eye,  
Will have your tongue too. This is a creature,  
Would she begin a sect, might quench the zeal  
Of all professors else, make proselytes  
Of who she but bid follow. /

**PAULINA**  
/ How! not women?

**Gentleman**  
Women will love her, that she is a woman  
More worth than any man; men, that she is  
The rarest of all women. /

**PAULINA**  
/ Had our prince,
Jewel of children, seen this hour, he had pair'd  
Well with this lord: there was not full a month  
Between their births. /

**LEONTES**  
/ Prithee, no more; cease; thou know'st  
He dies to me again when talk'd of: sure,  
When I shall see this gentleman, thy speeches  
Will bring me to consider that which may  
Unfurnish me of reason. They are come.

*Enter FLORIZEL and PERDITA*

Your mother was most true to wedlock, prince;  
For she did print your royal father off,  
Conceiving you: were I but twenty-one,  
Your father's image is so hit in you,  
His very air, that I should call you brother,  
As I did him, and speak of something wildly  
By us perform'd before. Most dearly welcome!  
And your fair princess,--goddess!--O, alas!  
I lost a couple, that 'twixt heaven and earth  
Might thus have stood begetting wonder as  
You, gracious couple, do: and then I lost--  
All mine own folly--the society,  
Amity too, of your brave father, whom,  
Though bearing misery, I desire my life  
Once more to look on him. /

**FLORIZEL**  
/ By his command
Have I here touch'd Sicilia and from him  
Give you all greetings that a king, at friend,  
Can send his brother: and, but infirmity  
Which waits upon worn times hath something seized  
His wish'd ability, he had himself  
The lands and waters 'twixt your throne and his  
Measured to look upon you; whom he loves--  
He bade me say so--more than all the sceptres  
And those that bear them living. /

**LEONTES**  
/ O my brother,
Good gentleman! the wrongs I have done thee stir  
Afresh within me, and these thy offices,  
So rarely kind, are as interpreters  
Of my behind-hand slackness. Welcome hither,  
As is the spring to the earth. And hath he too  
Exposed this paragon to the fearful usage,  
At least ungentle, of the dreadful Neptune,  
To greet a man not worth her pains, much less  
The adventure of her person? /

**FLORIZEL**  
/ Good my lord,
She came from Libya. /

**LEONTES**  
/ Where the warlike Smalus,  
That noble honor'd lord, is fear'd and loved?

**FLORIZEL**  
Most royal sir, from thence; from him, whose daughter  
His tears proclaim'd his, parting with her: thence,  
A prosperous south-wind friendly, we have cross'd,  
To execute the charge my father gave me  
For visiting your highness: my best train  
I have from your Sicilian shores dismiss'd;  
Who for Bohemia bend, to signify  
Not only my success in Libya, sir,  
But my arrival and my wife's in safety  
Here where we are. /

**LEONTES**  
/ The blessed gods
Purge all infection from our air whilst you  
Do climate here! You have a holy father,  
A graceful gentleman; against whose person,  
So sacred as it is, I have done sin:  
For which the heavens, taking angry note,  
Have left me issueless; and your father's blest,  
As he from heaven merits it, with you  
Worthy his goodness. What might I have been,  
Might I a son and daughter now have look'd on,  
Such goodly things as you! /

*Enter a Lord*

**Lord**  
/ Most noble sir,
That which I shall report will bear no credit,  
Were not the proof so nigh. Please you, great sir,  
Bohemia greets you from himself by me;  
Desires you to attach his son, who has--  
His dignity and duty both cast off--  
Fled from his father, from his hopes, and with  
A shepherd's daughter. /

**LEONTES**  
/ Where's Bohemia? speak.

**Lord**  
Here in your city; I now came from him:  
I speak amazedly; and it becomes  
My marvel and my message. To your court  
Whiles he was hastening, in the chase, it seems,  
Of this fair couple, meets he on the way  
The father of this seeming lady and  
Her brother, having both their country quitted  
With this young prince. /

**FLORIZEL**  
/ Camillo has betray'd me;  
Whose honor and whose honesty till now  
Endured all weathers. /

**Lord**  
/ Lay't so to his charge:  
He's with the king your father. /

**LEONTES**  
/ Who? Camillo?

**Lord**  
Camillo, sir; I spake with him; who now  
Has these poor men in question. Never saw I  
Wretches so quake: they kneel, they kiss the earth;  
Forswear themselves as often as they speak:  
Bohemia stops his ears, and threatens them  
With divers deaths in death. /

**PERDITA**  
/ O my poor father!
The heaven sets spies upon us, will not have  
Our contract celebrated. /

**LEONTES**  
/ You are married?

**FLORIZEL**  
We are not, sir, nor are we like to be;  
The stars, I see, will kiss the valleys first:  
The odds for high and low's alike.

**LEONTES**  
/ My lord,
Is this the daughter of a king? /

**FLORIZEL**  
/ She is,
When once she is my wife.

**LEONTES**  
That 'once' I see by your good father's speed  
Will come on very slowly. I am sorry,  
Most sorry, you have broken from his liking  
Where you were tied in duty, and as sorry  
Your choice is not so rich in worth as beauty,  
That you might well enjoy her. /

**FLORIZEL**  
/ Dear, look up:
Though Fortune, visible an enemy,  
Should chase us with my father, power no jot  
Hath she to change our loves. Beseech you, sir,  
Remember since you owed no more to time  
Than I do now: with thought of such affections,  
Step forth mine advocate; at your request  
My father will grant precious things as trifles.

**LEONTES**  
Would he do so, I'd beg your precious mistress,  
Which he counts but a trifle. /

**PAULINA**  
/ Sir, my liege,
Your eye hath too much youth in't: not a month  
'Fore your queen died, she was more worth such gazes  
Than what you look on now. /

**LEONTES**  
/ I thought of her,
Even in these looks I made. /

*\[To FLORIZEL]*  
/ But your petition
Is yet unanswer'd. I will to your father:  
Your honor not o'erthrown by your desires,  
I am friend to them and you: upon which errand  
I now go toward him; therefore follow me  
And mark what way I make: come, good my lord.

*Exeunt*

### SCENE II. Before LEONTES' palace.

**AUTOLYCUS**  
Now, had I not the dash of my former life in me,  
would preferment drop on my head. I brought the old  
man and his son aboard the prince: told him I heard  
them talk of a fardel and I know not what: but he  
at that time, overfond of the shepherd's daughter,  
so he then took her to be, who began to be much  
sea-sick, and himself little better, extremity of  
weather continuing, this mystery remained  
undiscovered. But 'tis all one to me; for had I  
been the finder out of this secret, it would not  
have relished among my other discredits.

*Enter Shepherd and Clown*

Here come those I have done good to against my will,  
and already appearing in the blossoms of their fortune.

**Shepherd**  
Come, boy; I am past moe children, but thy sons and  
daughters will be all gentlemen born.

**Clown**  
You are well met, sir. You denied to fight with me  
this other day, because I was no gentleman born.  
See you these clothes? say you see them not and  
think me still no gentleman born: you were best say  
these robes are not gentlemen born: give me the  
lie, do, and try whether I am not now a gentleman born.

**AUTOLYCUS**  
I know you are now, sir, a gentleman born.

**Clown**  
Ay, and have been so any time these four hours.

**Shepherd**  
And so have I, boy.

**Clown**  
So you have: but I was a gentleman born before my  
father; for the king's son took me by the hand, and  
called me brother; and then the two kings called my  
father brother; and then the prince my brother and  
the princess my sister called my father father; and  
so we wept, and there was the first gentleman-like  
tears that ever we shed.

**Shepherd**  
We may live, son, to shed many more.

**Clown**  
Ay; or else 'twere hard luck, being in so  
preposterous estate as we are.

**AUTOLYCUS**  
I humbly beseech you, sir, to pardon me all the  
faults I have committed to your worship and to give  
me your good report to the prince my master.

**Shepherd**  
Prithee, son, do; for we must be gentle, now we are  
gentlemen.

**Clown**  
Thou wilt amend thy life?

**AUTOLYCUS**  
Ay, an it like your good worship.

**Clown**  
Give me thy hand: I will swear to the prince thou  
art as honest a true fellow as any is in Bohemia.

**Shepherd**  
You may say it, but not swear it.

**Clown**  
Not swear it, now I am a gentleman? Let boors and  
franklins say it, I'll swear it.

**Shepherd**  
How if it be false, son?

**Clown**  
If it be ne'er so false, a true gentleman may swear  
it in the behalf of his friend: and I'll swear to  
the prince thou art a tall fellow of thy hands and  
that thou wilt not be drunk; but I know thou art no  
tall fellow of thy hands and that thou wilt be  
drunk: but I'll swear it, and I would thou wouldst  
be a tall fellow of thy hands.

**AUTOLYCUS**  
I will prove so, sir, to my power.

**Clown**  
Ay, by any means prove a tall fellow: if I do not  
wonder how thou darest venture to be drunk, not  
being a tall fellow, trust me not. Hark! the kings  
and the princes, our kindred, are going to see the  
queen's picture. Come, follow us: we'll be thy  
good masters.

*Exeunt*

### SCENE III. A chapel in PAULINA'S house.

*Enter LEONTES, POLIXENES, FLORIZEL, PERDITA, CAMILLO, PAULINA, and the
Lord*

**LEONTES**  
O grave and good Paulina, the great comfort  
That I have had of thee! /

**PAULINA**  
/ What, sovereign sir,  
I did not well I meant well. All my services  
You have paid home: but that you have vouchsafed,  
With your crown'd brother and these your contracted  
Heirs of your kingdoms, my poor house to visit,  
It is a surplus of your grace, which never  
My life may last to answer. /

**LEONTES**  
/ O Paulina,
We honor you with trouble: but we came  
To see the statue of our queen: your gallery  
Have we pass'd through, not without much content  
In many singularities; but we saw not  
That which my daughter came to look upon,  
The statue of her mother.

**PAULINA**  
As she lived peerless,
So her dead likeness, I do well believe,  
Excels whatever yet you look'd upon  
Or hand of man hath done; therefore I keep it  
Lonely, apart. But here it is: prepare  
To see the life as lively mock'd as ever  
Still sleep mock'd death: behold, and say 'tis well.

*PAULINA draws a curtain, and discovers HERMIONE standing like a statue*

I like your silence, it the more shows off  
Your wonder: but yet speak; first, you, my liege,  
Comes it not something near? /

**LEONTES**  
/ Her natural posture!  
Chide me, dear stone, that I may say indeed  
Thou art Hermione; or rather, thou art she  
In thy not chiding, for she was as tender  
As infancy and grace. But yet, Paulina,  
Hermione was not so much wrinkled, nothing  
So aged as this seems. /

**POLIXENES**  
/ O, not by much.

**PAULINA**  
So much the more our carver's excellence;  
Which lets go by some sixteen years and makes her  
As she lived now. /

**LEONTES**  
/ As now she might have done,  
So much to my good comfort, as it is  
Now piercing to my soul. O, thus she stood,  
Even with such life of majesty, warm life,  
As now it coldly stands, when first I woo'd her!  
I am ashamed: does not the stone rebuke me  
For being more stone than it? O royal piece,  
There's magic in thy majesty, which has  
My evils conjured to remembrance and  
From thy admiring daughter took the spirits,  
Standing like stone with thee. /

**PERDITA**  
/ And give me leave,
And do not say 'tis superstition, that  
I kneel and then implore her blessing. Lady,  
Dear queen, that ended when I but began,  
Give me that hand of yours to kiss. /

**PAULINA**  
/ O, patience!
The statue is but newly fix'd, the color's  
Not dry.

**CAMILLO**  
My lord, your sorrow was too sore laid on,  
Which sixteen winters cannot blow away,  
So many summers dry; scarce any joy  
Did ever so long live; no sorrow  
But kill'd itself much sooner. /

**POLIXENES**  
/ Dear my brother,
Let him that was the cause of this have power  
To take off so much grief from you as he  
Will piece up in himself. /

**PAULINA**  
/ Indeed, my lord,
If I had thought the sight of my poor image  
Would thus have wrought you,--for the stone is mine--  
I'd not have show'd it. /

**LEONTES**  
/ Do not draw the curtain.

**PAULINA**  
No longer shall you gaze on't, lest your fancy  
May think anon it moves. /

**LEONTES**  
/ Let be, let be.
Would I were dead, but that, methinks, already--  
What was he that did make it? See, my lord,  
Would you not deem it breathed? and that those veins  
Did verily bear blood? /

**POLIXENES**  
/ Masterly done:
The very life seems warm upon her lip.

**LEONTES**  
The fixture of her eye has motion in't,  
As we are mock'd with art. /

**PAULINA**  
/ I'll draw the curtain:  
My lord's almost so far transported that  
He'll think anon it lives. /

**LEONTES**  
/ O sweet Paulina,
Make me to think so twenty years together!  
No settled senses of the world can match  
The pleasure of that madness. Let 't alone.

**PAULINA**  
I am sorry, sir, I have thus far stirr'd you: but  
I could afflict you farther. /

**LEONTES**  
/ Do, Paulina;
For this affliction has a taste as sweet  
As any cordial comfort. Still, methinks,  
There is an air comes from her: what fine chisel  
Could ever yet cut breath? Let no man mock me,  
For I will kiss her. /

**PAULINA**  
/ Good my lord, forbear:  
The ruddiness upon her lip is wet;  
You'll mar it if you kiss it, stain your own  
With oily painting. Shall I draw the curtain?

**LEONTES**  
No, not these twenty years. /

**PERDITA**  
/ So long could I
Stand by, a looker on. /

**PAULINA**  
/ Either forbear,
Quit presently the chapel, or resolve you  
For more amazement. If you can behold it,  
I'll make the statue move indeed, descend  
And take you by the hand; but then you'll think--  
Which I protest against--I am assisted  
By wicked powers. /

**LEONTES**  
/ What you can make her do,  
I am content to look on: what to speak,  
I am content to hear; for 'tis as easy  
To make her speak as move. /

**PAULINA**  
/ It is required
You do awake your faith. Then all stand still;  
On: those that think it is unlawful business  
I am about, let them depart. /

**LEONTES**  
/ Proceed:
No foot shall stir. /

**PAULINA**  
/ Music, awake her; strike!

*Music*

'Tis time; descend; be stone no more; approach;  
Strike all that look upon with marvel. Come,  
I'll fill your grave up: stir, nay, come away,  
Bequeath to death your numbness, for from him  
Dear life redeems you. You perceive she stirs:

*HERMIONE comes down*

Start not; her actions shall be holy as  
You hear my spell is lawful: do not shun her  
Until you see her die again; for then  
You kill her double. Nay, present your hand:  
When she was young you woo'd her; now in age  
Is she become the suitor? /

**LEONTES**  
/ O, she's warm!
If this be magic, let it be an art  
Lawful as eating. /

**POLIXENES**  
/ She embraces him.

**CAMILLO**  
She hangs about his neck:  
If she pertain to life let her speak too.

**POLIXENES**  
Ay, and make't manifest where she has lived,  
Or how stolen from the dead. /

**PAULINA**  
/ That she is living,  
Were it but told you, should be hooted at  
Like an old tale: but it appears she lives,  
Though yet she speak not. Mark a little while.  
Please you to interpose, fair madam: kneel  
And pray your mother's blessing. Turn, good lady;  
Our Perdita is found. /

**HERMIONE**  
/ You gods, look down  
And from your sacred vials pour your graces  
Upon my daughter's head! Tell me, mine own.  
Where hast thou been preserved? where lived? how found  
Thy father's court? for thou shalt hear that I,  
Knowing by Paulina that the oracle  
Gave hope thou wast in being, have preserved  
Myself to see the issue. /

**PAULINA**  
/ There's time enough for that;  
Lest they desire upon this push to trouble  
Your joys with like relation. Go together,  
You precious winners all; your exultation  
Partake to every one. I, an old turtle,  
Will wing me to some wither'd bough and there  
My mate, that's never to be found again,  
Lament till I am lost. /

**LEONTES**  
/ O, peace, Paulina!
Thou shouldst a husband take by my consent,  
As I by thine a wife: this is a match,  
And made between's by vows. Thou hast found mine;  
But how, is to be question'd; for I saw her,  
As I thought, dead, and have in vain said many  
A prayer upon her grave. I'll not seek far--  
For him, I partly know his mind--to find thee  
An honorable husband. Come, Camillo,  
And take her by the hand, whose worth and honesty  
Is richly noted and here justified  
By us, a pair of kings. Let's from this place.  
What! look upon my brother: both your pardons,  
That e'er I put between your holy looks  
My ill suspicion. This is your son-in-law,  
And son unto the king, who, heavens directing,  
Is troth-plight to your daughter. Good Paulina,  
Lead us from hence, where we may leisurely  
Each one demand an answer to his part  
Perform'd in this wide gap of time since first  
We were dissever'd: hastily lead away.

*Exeunt*

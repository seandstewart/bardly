## Welcome to Bardly!

This is a free online resource for the works of William Shakespeare, featuring a library
of Shakespeare's plays in multiple lengths, allowing for companies of as few as 11
players. Our plays are extensively reviewed for consistency and are formatted for
optimum readability and shareability.

We have developed an automated system to count lines, track characters, and map
entrances and exits which is used to create high-level, interactive indexes at the top
of every edition of each play. Additionally, every block of dialogue can be directly
linked to for instant sharing of snippets or quotes, or simply to catch a friend up that
wasn't paying attention :smirk:

At Bardly, you'll find the most accurate, useable, and cross-device compatible website
for Shakespeare's works available.

Happy bard-ing :flaticon-storytelling-black:

!!! note ":construction:"

    This website is currently under construction, but our library of plays is complete!
